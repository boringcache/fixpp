## Canonical sequence (user-authored)

```
0.  /speckit-constitution         (one-time per project)

PHASE 0 — SPEC
1.  /speckit-specify <description>   creates feature branch + spec.md
2.  /speckit-clarify                  mandatory for ABI/threading/wire/codegen/session/security [const §XVI.3]

PHASE 1 — DESIGN
3.  /speckit-plan                     plan.md + research.md + data-model.md + contracts/ + quickstart.md
4.  /gate-a <feature-id>              Codex design review loop; applies gate-a-{done,waived}
                                      [const §XVII.1] — blockers resolved BEFORE /tasks

PHASE 2 — TASKS
5.  /speckit-tasks                    dependency-ordered task list
6.  /speckit-analyze                  cross-artifact consistency; remediate findings
7.  /speckit-checklist                api/abi/nfr review checklists (audience: Gate B)
##8.  /speckit-taskstoissues            optional — sync to GitHub issues   [DISABLED]

9.  /speckit-checklist-audit          MANDATORY gate — BLOCKS step 10.
                                      CHECKLIST AUDIT. EXECUTOR: the
                                      /speckit-checklist-audit skill — do NOT
                                      hand-walk it ad hoc, do NOT rely on
                                      /speckit-implement's weak unticked-box
                                      prompt as the gate.
                                      For every domain checklist in
                                      specs/<id>/checklists/ (the auto
                                      /specify `requirements.md` is closed at
                                      steps 1–2 and is exempt): the
                                      orchestrator audits each CHK item
                                      against spec.md, cross-checked vs
                                      plan/tasks/data-model/contracts and the
                                      signed-off design-doc anchor. Every
                                      item MUST be ticked [x] with an inline
                                      disposition tag:
                                        SPEC-FIXED      — spec.md edited
                                        DD-DECIDED §X   — settled in the
                                                          signed-off design
                                                          doc (anchor rule);
                                                          recorded, not re-spec'd
                                        WAIVED: <reason> — recorded; allowed
                                                          ONLY for items NOT
                                                          tagged Completeness/

                                      gaps MUST be SPEC-FIXED or DD-DECIDED —
                                      never WAIVED. Every design-doc §/RC
                                      anchor cited by spec is spot-verified to
                                      exist in the signed-off revision (no
                                      dangling ref). Record = the checklist
                                      file itself (boxes + disposition tags).
                                      If ANY item is SPEC-FIXED, re-run
                                      step 6 (/speckit-analyze) before step 10
                                      (the spec edit invalidates the prior
                                      drift check). Exit: zero
                                      un-dispositioned [ ] boxes across all
                                      domain checklists.

PHASE 3 — IMPLEMENT
10. /speckit-implement                runs tasks, marks [X] (NOT evidence-based — see step 12)

11. /simplify                         3 specialized Opus review agents (reuse / quality /
                                      efficiency) → orchestrator triages; phase-implementer
                                      fixes genuine in-scope simplifications + any real
                                      Gate-B-relevant defect;
                                      defer behavioral/perf redesigns + ambiguous items as
                                      tracked follow-ups in the verify decision doc
                                      [const §XVI.7 — before verify, NOT merely before PR]

12. /speckit-verify <feature>         MANDATORY local Tier-1 mirror [const §XVII.8]
                                      → .specify/decisions/<feature>-verify.md
                                      verdict must be GREEN or YELLOW before continuing

13. Gate-B preconditions              [const §XVII.8] /gate-b's pre-flight HARD-BLOCKS the
                                      loop on all of: verify-record non-RED (4b), feature-
                                      completeness audit non-failing (4d), Gate A evidence
                                      present (4c), and the independence rule (5). The
                                      catalogue + coverage-index ROW WRITES still ship as
                                      explicit tasks.md tasks (T052/T053/T058 — manual);
                                      4d verifies their on-disk state matches the diff.
                                      No separate skill needed — invoke /gate-b directly;
                                      it refuses to start when any precondition is unmet.

14. /gate-b <branch>                  Codex hostile review of main..HEAD on local branch
                                      → .specify/decisions/<feature>-gateb.md (round 1..N)
                                      Fix-loop (Claude fixer rounds 1-2 → Codex fixer rounds 3-4)
                                      converge to SHIP-AS-IS or SHIP-WITH-FIXES + documented waivers

PHASE 4 — PUBLISH + MERGE
15. SecondBrain pass, THEN            TWO PARTS, in this order.
    git push -u origin <branch>       (a) Apply close-out.md row 3's brain/ update ON
                                      THE BRANCH, then run BOTH freshness halves
                                      LOCALLY — neither CI job can cover the other's:
                                        · in-repo `refs` — run what
                                          .github/workflows/brain-freshness.yml runs
                                          (DERIVE it from the workflow; do not copy a
                                          command list here — that job also carries the
                                          workflow linter and both line-citation gates)
                                        · `refs_external` — the parent's
                                          tools/brain-external-sweep.sh, the WRAPPER,
                                          never a bare `check_brain.py sweep`. Report
                                          the execution COUNT.
                                      (b) publish — only after Codex converged.
                                      Rationale + the Gate-B-scoping rule: close-out.md
                                      row 3.
16. gh pr create                      body links to verify + Gate A + Gate B records
17. Apply gate-{a,b}-{done,waived}    paired-evidence rule [const §XVII.8]
                                      via gh pr edit OR /gate-b's Post-loop §3 if re-run on PR
18. gh pr merge                       user-driven

19. MARK DONE — close-out bookkeeping  MANDATORY. The surface list lives in
                                      `.specify/close-out.md` — ONE source of
                                      truth, not a second copy here. It splits
                                      ALWAYS rows from CONDITIONAL ones (row +
                                      trigger), tags each auto or manual, and
                                      requires an explicit disposition per row:
                                      DONE or N/A:<reason>. A blank row is an
                                      unknown row, not a skipped one.
                                      Paste its §3 template into the feature's
                                      Gate B record and fill every row — a
                                      filled instance per PR is the evidence
                                      that close-out ran, which the old inline
                                      list never produced.

20. Review and close all issues for this phase

## Reconciliation notes (Opus, cross-check 2026-05-17)

Cross-checked against agent memory + the submodule constitution. Sequence
sound, matches memory. Disposition (user-approved 2026-05-17):

- **[A] APPLIED.** Constitution §XVI.7 amended: "before PR open" →
  "before `/speckit-verify`", with the matrix-invalidation rationale.
- **[B] MERGED** into the canonical block (step 11: 3 specialized Opus
  review agents → Opus triage). Justification: review-agent severities are
  unreliable — 004-wire-codec, the agents' headline "O(n²) DoS" was a
  false alarm; the real defect was a `static thread_local` group-slice
  aliasing + zero-alloc-invariant breach, separated only by Opus triage.
- **[C] MERGED** into the canonical block as step 13 (the §XVII.8
  completeness-audit / catalogue second Gate-B precondition).
- **[D] Open coupling.** Step 8 (`/speckit-taskstoissues`) is DISABLED;
  step 20 (close all issues) is its pair and is a no-op while 8 is
  off. Re-enable together.
- **[E] APPLIED (user-directed 2026-05-17).** Inserted the "MARK DONE —
  close-out bookkeeping" step (now step 19). Root cause: the canonical
  pipeline ended at merge + a no-op close-issues step (the disabled-step-8
  pair), so marking trackers done was done only from memory and items were
  dropped — symptom: `retro-coverage-remediation-plan.md` progress log
  stalled at "⏳ next" though 001/002/003 all merged (#69/#70/#71);
  recurring post-PR `gate-a-done` label gap. Step 19 enumerates every
  close-out surface (catalogue, submodule bump, gate label, phase-4 Track
  Log + module README, controlling decision-doc log, lifecycle sign-off,
  memory) so the set is explicit, not recalled. The prior close-issues step
  shifted out to step 20.
- **[F] APPLIED (user-directed 2026-05-18).** Inserted the "CHECKLIST
  AUDIT" MANDATORY gate (now step 9) between step 8 (`/speckit-checklist`)
  and step 10 (`/speckit-implement`). Root cause: `/speckit-checklist`
  emits domain checklists but nothing required their CHK items to be
  dispositioned before code is written — they were de facto deferred to
  Gate B (step 14, post-implement), so a requirements-quality defect could
  survive into implementation and only surface at hostile PR review. The
  audit is a spec-vs-{plan,tasks,data-model,contracts,design-doc} review;
  disposition is recorded in the checklist file itself (SPEC-FIXED /
  DD-DECIDED §X / WAIVED). Completeness/Clarity/Consistency gaps cannot be
  WAIVED. SPEC-FIXED dispositions loop back to step 6 (`/speckit-analyze`)
  so a spec edit cannot bypass the drift check. First applied to
  006-async-mutex `checklists/concurrency.md` (24 PASS / 6 GAP / 9 MINOR /
  1 ACTION; 3 SPEC-FIXED: CHK017/CHK029/CHK037; CHK031 anchor spot-check
  verified clean against `2f-async-mutex.md` v1.5).
- **[G] APPLIED (user-directed 2026-05-19).** (i) The step-9 CHECKLIST
  AUDIT gate is now backed by a real command: the `/speckit-checklist-audit`
  skill is named as its EXECUTOR (it had been a prose-only orchestrator
  step and was therefore repeatedly skipped — only `/speckit-implement`'s
  fragile unticked-box prompt caught it; that prompt is no longer the gate).
  First exercised on 007-threading-clock `checklists/gate.md` (46/46;
  1 SPEC-FIXED: CHK012/F-1 cross-thread bench-soft ambiguity; anchors
  spot-verified clean against `2d-threading.md` v0.4). (ii) Step numbering
  normalized to integers — the inserted [E]/[F] gates had created the
  fractional/letter labels 8.5, 9.5, 10b. New mapping: old 8.5→9, 9→10,
  9.5→11, 10→12, 10b→13, 11→14, 12→15, 13→16, 14→17, 15→18, 16→19, 17→20;
  every internal "step N" cross-reference and the [B]/[C]/[D]/[E]/[F]
  references above were updated to the integer scheme. No step semantics
  changed; this is a label-only normalization plus the executor binding.
- **[H] APPLIED (user-directed 2026-05-22).** Per-phase Sonnet implementer
  is now backed by a bound agent: `.claude/agents/phase-implementer-sonnet.md`
  (at the parent root, beside `gate-*.md` commands). The orchestrator
  invokes it as `subagent_type=phase-implementer-sonnet` and passes only
  the per-call delta (task IDs / fix queue, feature context, anchor
  paths). The recurring brief — anchor citation, TDD ordering, scope
  discipline, constitutional bindings, the anti-pattern library from
  memory (placeholder tests, FSM-end-state false-pass, counting-PMR
  alloc-guard escapes, fork-inherited asio pools, asio post-resume
  executor bouncing, co_spawn terminal-only cancellation default,
  codegen emitter staleness, lcov DA/BRDA coverage basis, profraw
  staleness), commit-message convention, `no-EnterWorktree/no-push`
  constraints, and the CodeGraph lookup/sync rules — lives in the
  agent file, not in each brief. Two callsites: step 10
  (`/speckit-implement` per-phase Sonnet subagent per
  `[[feedback_speckit_subagent_phasing]]`) and step 14 (`/gate-b`
  Sonnet fixer rounds 1–2). The orchestrator's parent-verification step
  does NOT go away — it shifts from re-checking persona-line compliance
  to spot-checking dispositions and report claims against
  `[[feedback_subagent_phase_verification_two_traps]]` /
  `[[feedback_tracking_pmr_resource_false_pass]]`. Same date: `gate-b.md`
  added a `## CodeGraph — sub-agent expectations` section that every
  reviewer/triage/fixer brief references; `gate-a.md` added a `##
  CodeGraph — when it applies in Gate A` section scoping Gate-A's
  bundle-only review (no `codegraph sync` in Gate A — no code changes).
- **[I] APPLIED (user-directed 2026-05-22).** Two new bound agents
  carry the analysis steps out of the main session into subagent
  context (the heaviest cross-artifact reasoning was burning the
  orchestrator's context budget):
    * `.claude/agents/checklist-auditor.md` — canonical executor for
      step 9 (`/speckit-checklist-audit`). Walks every domain checklist
      CHK item, dispositions PASS / SPEC-FIXED / DD-DECIDED §X /
      WAIVED:<reason> with the realizability sub-check from
      `[[feedback_checklist_audit_realizability]]`, spot-verifies
      design-doc anchors, edits checklists in place. SPEC-FIXED
      autonomous (orchestrator diffs to verify); Completeness/Clarity/
      Consistency MAY NEVER be WAIVED.
    * `.claude/agents/spec-analyzer.md` — canonical executor for step 6
      (`/speckit-analyze`). Read-only; runs detection passes A–F
      (Duplication / Ambiguity / Underspecification / Constitution
      Alignment / Coverage Gaps / Inconsistency); CRITICAL / HIGH /
      MEDIUM / LOW severity; returns a structured report inline. No
      file writes (the upstream skill mandates read-only).
  Both use CodeGraph lightweight tools (`codegraph_search` / `node`
  for symbol-existence checks; `callers` when a referenced shape might
  break consumers) with explicit `projectPath`. Neither runs
  `codegraph sync` — analyze is read-only, audit edits checklists/
  spec.md only (no library code).
  Orchestrator's parent-verification gate carries forward: spot-check
  dispositions (auditor) and finding severities (analyzer); a
  subagent's "all green" or "0 CRITICAL" does NOT replace the
  spot-check, by the same memory-grounded reasoning that applies to
  `phase-implementer-sonnet` (per [H]).

- **[J] APPLIED (user-directed 2026-05-27).** Compounding-engineering surface
  for the anti-pattern library, per `pipeline/pipeline-review.md` item #4.
  Two coordinated edits: (1) `/gate-b` Post-loop gains a new §4
  ("Anti-pattern library — propose entries for new burn classes") between
  label-set and user summary; the orchestrator reads this loop's triage
  docs, judges each Root Cause against existing entries in
  `.claude/agents/phase-implementer-sonnet.md`, and drafts candidate
  entries for any new burn classes. (2) Step 19 gains bullet `j` — commit
  the user-approved entries to the agent file as part of the post-merge
  close-out. *(Annotation 2026-08-29: step 19's inline bullets were replaced
  by `.specify/close-out.md`; this disposition is now §2 row 15 there. The
  text above is left as written — it records what was decided then, and
  editing an accepted record destroys that.)* Root cause: the library is load-bearing (each entry
  represents a prior burn the implementer agent now avoids), but
  capturing new entries has been manual transcription from memory and
  noted as a recurring maintenance burden in `pipeline/ai-sdd-pipeline.md`
  Cons §6. The 15+ entries today were each ~one Gate B cycle's worth of
  learning; the next 15 should arrive automatically, not from
  recollection. Common case is no-op (mature features re-use known
  patterns); the surface is cheap when there is nothing to capture.

- **[K] APPLIED (user-directed 2026-09-10).** The SecondBrain update moves from
  close-out (step 19 / `close-out.md` row 3) to **step 15a, on the branch, before
  the push**, and close-out row 3 becomes a **re-check** with a stated trigger
  rather than the place the work happens. Root cause: brain/ edits were landing
  as post-merge direct-to-`main` pushes or separate PRs (`337`: `fcbcf7cb`;
  `pr367-264`: `89f453ef`; `360-361`: PR #383), so the freshness instruments
  first ran on a commit **nobody was going to review** — and `brain-freshness.yml`
  is **not in branch protection's required set** (derived from
  `repos/.../branches/main/protection`; required = `Gate A`, `Gate B`,
  `tier{1,2,3}-required`), so a red there does not block anything. It is
  unobserved, not blocking, which is the argument for running the instruments
  locally rather than letting CI be the discovery channel. Folded into step 15
  rather than inserted as a new step or a `14b`: `[G]` normalized this file to
  integers, and `close-out.md` plus the constitution cite these steps **by
  number** — a renumber rots every one of those citations (the #310 class).
  Cost of folding the brain edit into the feature branch is **zero extra CI**:
  the tiers already run on the PR, and `brain-freshness.yml` triggers on
  `pull_request: branches: ["**"]` ungated by labels. Two further points carried
  in `close-out.md` row 3 rather than repeated here: the second trigger arm
  (close-out itself writes `phases/**` and `decisions/**`, which is exactly what
  `refs_external` names, so it can dangle a ref **after** the pre-push pass), and
  the Gate-B scoping question a commit inserted between steps 14 and 15 raises.
- **[L] APPLIED (user-directed 2026-09-23).** The implementer and Gate B fixer
  move from Sonnet to the `opus` model alias (always the latest Opus, never a
  pinned version), and the agent file is renamed
  `.claude/agents/phase-implementer.md` (`subagent_type=phase-implementer`); the
  names `phase-implementer-sonnet` in [H], [I] and [J] above mean that file and
  are left as written, since they record what was decided then. `checklist-auditor`
  and `spec-analyzer` move to `opus` too. Two mechanisms come with it:
  (1) the orchestrator never implements — `/speckit-implement` step 5a loses its
  "MAY implement directly" carve-out, and a parent-root PreToolUse hook
  (`.claude/scripts/pretooluse-orchestrator-library-edit-guard.sh`) blocks
  main-session edits to library code in every worktree (classified by file
  type, no override — an owner-directed change still goes to the implementer); (2) a comment-claim lint (`.claude/scripts/check-comment-claims.py`,
  parent root) that flags added comment lines recording a result instead of a
  condition. The implementer runs it before reporting and the orchestrator
  re-runs it between phases (step 10) and after every Gate B fixer round
  (step 14). Constitution v3.0 (MAJOR) defines what the orchestrator may and may
  not do (Article XVI §6: mutation proofs in a scratch copy, merge conflicts and
  codegen regeneration to the implementer) and names roles instead of models
  (Articles XVI §7, XVII §4–§5, XX §5). Rationale: PR #258's Gate B record in the
  research repository (decisions/speckit/pr258-python-fold-gateb.md) — rounds 3-8
  were "Codex-review + orchestrator-fix with no Step B triage at all".
