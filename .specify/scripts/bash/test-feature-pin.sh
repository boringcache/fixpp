# Guards the fixpp-local patch to .specify/scripts/bash/common.sh (fixpp#490):
# the tracked .specify/feature.json pin must not resolve an unrelated branch's
# feature. A pin is trusted only on the branch it records, or when it names an
# existing specs/<branch> itself — its identity is the whole normalized path, never its
# basename. Runs the repo's own common.sh + check-prerequisites.sh inside a
# throwaway git repo, so the real pin and working tree are never touched.
# NOT wired into CI (a .specify/-only change runs no matrix, by choice): run it
# by hand after any Spec-Kit refresh — a refresh that drops the patch goes RED.
