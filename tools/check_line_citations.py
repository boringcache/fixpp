# Instrument for issue #310: line-number citations in comments rot silently.
#
# A citation naming a line number is a claim about a file that keeps moving.
# Nobody has to touch the CITING file for it to become false -- the TARGET
# drifts and the citation rots in place. Nothing ever fails; the reader is sent
# to the wrong line and usually lands on an unrelated comment, which reads as
# plausible.
#
# Three spellings exist, and a sweep keyed on any one of them reports clean over
# the other two (#310 records both halves of that failure):
#
#   A  `file.cpp:NNN`      -- has a filename, so the target is RESOLVABLE
#   B  `at line 2234`      -- NO filename: undetectable by any filename-keyed
#                             sweep, AND ambiguous about which file it means
#   C  `(:64)`             -- bare self-citation, same blindness as B
#
# THREE MODES, and the distinctions are the point:
#
#   --census  reports CANDIDATES with the cited line's ACTUAL content beside the
#             claim, for a human to adjudicate. It does NOT emit a rot verdict:
#             whether a comment's prose still describes the code at line N is not
#             mechanically decidable. The ONE exception is `out-of-range`, which
#             is decided here because it cannot be anything but a defect.
#
#   --staged / --range  GATE newly ADDED lines only. Gating the whole tree would
#             be noise; gating additions stops the bleeding without demanding a
#             tree-wide migration first.
#
#   --shift-audit  the OPPOSITE direction (#336). The three modes above are all
#             aimed at GROWTH, so an edit that INVALIDATES existing citations --
#             which adds none -- passes all three. This one asks whether a range
#             MOVED the lines other files already cite.
#
# THE FIX FOR A FLAGGED CITATION IS TO DELETE THE NUMBER, NOT TO CORRECT IT.
# Re-pointing `session.cpp:1258` at `session.cpp:1265` re-arms the same defect
# with a fresh half-life. Cite a function/struct name plus a short quoted phrase
# instead; that survives arbitrary line motion, and grep finds it if the quoted
# text is ever changed. CONTRIBUTING.md carries the worked example.

# Citations cannot live in a fuzz seed or an ABI baseline, and those directories
# hold binary blobs that git emits raw into a diff when they contain no NUL in
# the first 8000 bytes -- decoding that as strict UTF-8 throws, which would
# abort a commit that merely added a corpus seed.
# ⚠️ The doc trees are here because #336 WIDENED RE_A to `.md` and to a leading
# dot -- expressly so `.specify/2d-threading.md:448` would match -- and then left
# the ADDITION gate unable to reach a single one of them. `--staged`/`--range`
# diff `-- SCAN_DIRS`, so the widening was inert for them: measured, one commit
# adding the IDENTICAL citation to src/, specs/, brain/, spec/ and .specify/ was
# reported for src/ ALONE. A regex widened for a directory the gate cannot see is
# the same false zero as any other -- the pattern matched, and nothing fed it.
#
# --shift-audit was never affected: it builds its index from `all_tracked`, which
# is the whole tree. So the two halves of #336 disagreed about what "the tree" is,
# and only the growth half was short.
#
# Cost of the widening, measured over the eleven merges 37eb372f..bb22be26 before
# taking it: 3 of them newly report, 2-3 citations each, all in `spec/*.md` or a
# checklist. Re-derive rather than trust that -- `--range <merge>~1..<merge>`.
# ⚠️ The 2026-09-12 widening is the SECOND time this list was the blind spot,
# and the lesson is that the list itself is the thing to re-derive, not trust.
# #336 added the four doc trees after the census reported `0 out of range` over
# a scope holding almost none of this repo's line-cited documents. That fix was
# correct and still short: `ci/`, `conan/`, `.github/` and every top-level
# NON-`.md` file were still unscanned, and `ci/` alone holds 33 citations -- in
# shell scripts that are themselves CI gates, so a rotted pin there misroutes
# the reader of a gate.
#
# Re-derive rather than trusting this list, the way the gap was found:
#
#   git ls-files | awk -F/ '{print (NF==1) ? "TOP:"$1 : $1"/"}' | sort -u
#
# and diff that against the entries here. A tree that exists and is not listed
# is invisible, silently, in the direction of clean.

# Form A. The negative lookbehind keeps `a/b/c.cpp:12` from also matching as
# `b/c.cpp:12` and `c.cpp:12`.
#
# `md` and the leading `.` were added 2026-08-31 (#336, user decision). The
# original rationale for excluding `.md` -- "the tree already holds hundreds of
# `constitution.md:456` refs" -- does not survive contact with what the gate
# actually does: --staged/--range read ADDED LINES ONLY, so a pre-existing
# population is not a reason to permit NEW members of it. A `.md` line citation
# rots exactly like a `.cpp` one, and #336 exists because that rot was silent.
#
# The leading `.` matters as much as the extension: without it
# `.specify/2d-threading.md:448` matches NOTHING -- not at the dot (wrong class),
# not one character in (the lookbehind rejects it) -- and `.specify/` is where
# this repo's line-cited design docs live.
#
# ⚠️ A pattern only decides what it is FED. This widening sat inert in the
# addition gate until SCAN_DIRS was widened to match it; see the note there
# before assuming a regex change here reaches `--staged`/`--range` at all.
#
# `[0-9]`, not `\d`: `\d` also matches Unicode decimal digits, which --shift-audit's
# ASCII `git grep` prefilter drops. A decider that out-matches its own prefilter
# is a silent drop; keeping the two in step costs nothing here.
# The separator is `:` OR ` L` -- `reify_dispatch.hpp L15-24` is the same claim
# as `reify_dispatch.hpp:15`, spelled the way a GitHub permalink reads, and it
# was ungated until 2026-09-12. Found by sweeping for spellings rather than by
# running the detector, which is the only way a detector's own blind spot is ever
# found. `\s+L` cannot collide with the adjacent hash/version text in this tree:
# it needs a literal capital L followed IMMEDIATELY by a digit, so `Messages.hpp
# 827a9bd0` and `foo.cpp Line 12` are both non-matches.
# EXTENSIONS. The original list was C++ plus `md`, which silently declared that
# only C++ and markdown rot. Derived by COMPLEMENT (see the note above RE_B on
# how), the tree also line-cites, and these are measured counts, not guesses:
#
#   .xml   435   `dictionaries/FIX44.xml:2805-2824` -- and the dictionaries DO
#                move; feature 082 changed group registration across all of them
#   .yml    62   `tier1.yml:392`, `cache-cleanup.yml:207`  (citation-ok: example spellings, not citations)
#   .txt    45   `CMakeLists.txt:401`, `ci/expected-eligible-tests.txt:13-19`
#   .cmake  20 · .sh 19 · .py 16 · .json 7 · .toml 3
#
# The list stays EXPLICIT rather than becoming `\.\w+`: a generic extension turns
# every `host.com:8080` and `image:1.2` into a citation. Precision here is worth
# more than catching an extension nobody has used yet, because a gate that cries
# wolf gets narrowed by the next person and the narrowing is what rots.
#
# The `:~` form is accepted too: `session.cpp:~555` is the same claim wearing an
# approximation mark, and the tree had three of them, one in a test's RED-proof
# mutation instruction -- where following the wrong line means proving nothing.

# alias, not by path, so form A's `file.ext:` pattern cannot see form D AT ALL:
# there is no extension to match. It was therefore ungated and uncounted from
# #326 through #336 while being, by census, the form that reaches SHIPPED
# HEADERS -- `include/fixpp/core/error.hpp` carried 22 of them.
#
# Issue #310's own thread named three confirmed form-D rots (`[2h §6.6]:1167-1204`,
# `[2h §6.4.1]:1124`, `[2h §6.6]:1191`) and each was found INCIDENTALLY, by
# unrelated work -- never by a sweep, because no sweep could see them. That is the
# issue's "blind on an axis" thesis landing on the instrument built to test it.
#
# Precision: surveyed tree-wide before taking it, every match was a doc alias --
# `[2h §...]`, `[2d]`, `[const §...]`. Zero false positives. The shape is narrow
# because a `]` immediately followed by `:` and a digit has no other use here:
# markdown link definitions (`[1]: https://`) put a space and a scheme after the
# colon, and code indexing (`a[i]`) is never followed by `:\d`.
# The optional backtick covers the `[2d §4.7]`:864 spelling -- the alias closes
# its code span before the colon. Surveyed: it adds recall and NO new shape, every
# match is still a doc alias.

# Form F: a bare ` :NNN` self-citation with NO opening paren and NO closing
# bracket -- `the veto path at :2491`, `the enum arm at :172`, `:1594) all leave
# this pin green`. Form C requires a `(` and form D a `]`, so this spelling fell
# between them and was ungated.
#
# It was NOT found by the detector. It surfaced because sweep agents rewriting
# form-A/B/C citations kept encountering it in the same sentences and removed it
# by hand -- i.e. a human-shaped reading found what the pattern could not, which
# is the same way forms D and E were found. That is the durable lesson here:
# every one of these spellings was found by looking at the TEXT, never by
# running the instrument over it.
#
# Precision, surveyed tree-wide before taking it: `{2,}` digits and a required
# preceding SPACE keep it off C++ bit-fields (`unsigned x :16;` -- zero in this
# tree, and checked), off `std::`, and off `key: 123` YAML (colon-then-space is
# the opposite order). Every match's left context is prose: `at :N`, `guard at
# :N`, `comment at :N`.
# The separator before the colon is a space OR a BACKTICK. The backticked cell
# spelling -- a markdown table whose whole cell is `` `:616` `` -- is how this
# repo tabulates per-symbol line numbers, and it is invisible to form C (needs
# `(`), to form D (needs `]`) and to the space-only form F. It was found the
# same way as every other spelling here: by reading text a sweep had already
# rewritten, not by running the detector.
#
# THE TILDE IS ACCEPTED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE COLON, and it was not always.
# `~:1250` was gated from the start; `:~1910` -- the same claim with the
# approximation mark on the other side of the colon -- was not, and lived in
# `session.cpp` untouched through the whole #310 sweep. This is form B's defect
# recurring in a DIFFERENT regex: `RE_B` was `~?\blines?`, taking `~line 3232`
# (the spelling the ticket quoted) and missing `line ~958` for the life of the
# gate. Twice now, a tilde has been gated on the side the example happened to
# use. When a pattern admits an optional mark ANYWHERE, write it on both sides
# and let the self-test carry an arm for each -- the cost is one `?`, and the
# omission is invisible to every instrument including this one.
#
# Surveyed before taking it, over the tool's own 6265-file enumeration (pass
# SCAN_DIRS as argv -- interpolating it into a shell `git grep` silently
# returns nothing): 11 hits, 2 live and 9 frozen, and ZERO false positives.
#
# The lookbehind sits on the char before the SPACE/BACKTICK and excludes only `]`, so a
# `[2h §6.6] :1167` is counted once (as form D) rather than twice. The trailing
# guard drops a C++ bit-field `unsigned x :16;` -- zero in this tree today, so
# the guard is precaution rather than a measured need, and is marked as such.

# ── What --shift-audit CHARGES versus what it only REPORTS ───────────────────
#
# Wiring the audit as a hard gate (#336) is what made this distinction load-
# bearing: over ten real merges the mode raised hundreds of content findings and
# a dozen-odd shifting hunks, and a gate that stops that range stops ordinary
# work. Both narrowings below are about WHICH findings fail the build. NEITHER
# hides a finding: every one is still printed and still written to --json,
# carrying `gated: false`, and the report prints both denominators. A narrowing
# you cannot count is a blind spot; one you can is a scope.
#
# The figures quoted below are pinned to an IMMUTABLE range so they cannot rot
# in place, and any of them is one command away rather than taken on trust:
#
#   python3 tools/check_line_citations.py --shift-audit 0e5225fc..b6d9ed8c
#
# Re-derive before citing a number here at any other commit; a scope measured on
# one range is not a property of the tree.
#
# [2] FROZEN CITERS. `specs/<id>/` is a per-feature bundle -- spec, plan, tasks,
# research, checklists, contracts. On the pinned range, 312 of the 420 findings
# cite from one.
# Rot there is real and worth listing, but nobody reads a shipped feature's
# bundle to navigate today's source, and remediating them is #310's job, not a
# merge gate's. `spec/` (singular) is the LIVE surface and is NOT frozen.
#
# "Frozen" means ARCHIVAL, and a path shape alone cannot say that: `specs/<id>/`
# equally matches the bundle of the feature currently IN FLIGHT, which the PR
# under test is actively writing. Exempting that one would let a PR rot its own
# spec's citations behind a hard gate, and `--range` does not cover it (that
# gate refuses ADDED citations, not existing ones the edit invalidates).
#
# So the lifecycle question is answered from the RANGE rather than asserted from
# the path: a bundle this range touches at all is in flight and is charged; every
# other bundle is archival and is only reported. Derived, not claimed -- and it
# needs no notion of merge state, which nothing here could verify.

# [1] SHIFTS THAT MOVED NOTHING. The check deliberately runs on EVERY changed
# `.md`, including those nothing resolvably cites, because a form-B citation
# (`at line 448`) names no file and so resolves to nothing -- see the check's
# own header. That stays true, and every such hunk is still reported. What
# changed is that only a hunk with at least one citation KNOWN to have moved
# fails the build: on the pinned range 12 of the 17 hunks moved NOTHING at all
# (13 go ungated -- the extra one moved only an archival citer, so the two
# denominators are not the same number and must not be quoted as one), among them
# `brain/log.md` growing by 262 lines and a 108-line append near the end of
# `spec/behaviors-and-limitations.md` -- a file nearly every PR edits, because
# a B&L functional delta is a Gate B precondition.
#
# The frozen-citer rule above governs check [2]. Check [1] does NOT charge at
# all -- it reports, and only [2] decides the exit code. That is not a softening;
# it removes a check that could only ever be wrong in two directions:
#
#   REDUNDANT. After the form-B exemption, the only thing [1] could still charge
#   was a shift moving a resolvable form-A citation -- and [2] catches every one
#   of those STRUCTURALLY, not by luck. If a citation at line n moved by k, then
#   head[n] is base[n-k]: either the content differs, which is "cited line
#   CONTENT CHANGED", or it is byte-identical, and then mapped_base_line returns
#   n-k != n, which is "SILENTLY REPOINTED". There is no third outcome. Measured
#   as well as argued: across ten merges plus the motivating commit 9e0b332d,
#   [1]'s gate never once decided a verdict [2] had not already decided.
#
#   AND WRONG. `hunk_shifts` asks whether a HUNK changed the line count, which is
#   not whether a CITATION moved. An insertion above a citation paired with a
#   deletion above it nets to zero: the citation still lands on the same
#   content, [2] correctly reports nothing, and [1] failed the build for two
#   shifting hunks. A moved paragraph is exactly that shape. Charging it is a
#   spurious HIT -- the failure this repo's rule 2 is about, inside the check
#   written to enforce it. Arm 5d pins it.
#
# So [1] keeps the job it is uniquely able to do -- being the only check that
# can SEE a form-B document shift, since form B names no file and resolves to
# nothing -- and stops pretending it can price one.

# Deliberate, reviewed exception. `--census` reports these as their own bucket:
# the marker is itself a claim (that this number will not rot), so it has to stay
# countable rather than vanish from the instrument built to audit it.

# ── --shift-audit: the ROT direction ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Issue #336. The three modes above are all aimed at GROWTH -- they fail a diff
# that ADDS a line-number citation. An edit that INVALIDATES existing citations
# adds none, so all three pass clean. Insert a paragraph near the top of a
# document that is cited by line number and every citation into it below the
# insertion point silently re-points at the wrong content: no diff hunk anywhere
# near the citing files, no error, no warning.
#
# That is not hypothetical. Commit 9e0b332d inserted a 47-line note ~12 lines
# from the top of `.specify/2d-threading.md`, a file cited by line number from
# more than a dozen others; 4afaed04 restored them by making every amendment
# line-shift-free. The citation gate ran and passed throughout.
#
# TWO CHECKS, and they see different things:
#
#   [1] LINE-SHIFT  -- did a changed document move its own line numbers? Needs
#       no citation to resolve, so it is the ONLY check that can cover form B
#       (`at line 448`, which names no file and is unattributable by any tool).
#       The motivating citation was form B, so this check carries that case
#       alone. Scoped to `.md` citation targets: the append-at-the-end / edit-
#       in-place discipline is a DOCUMENT discipline, and applying it to source
#       would demand every code edit preserve its line count.
#
#   [2] CITED-LINE CONTENT -- for each resolvable `file:NNN` citation into a
#       changed file, is the content of line NNN the same before and after? A
#       line number that still exists is not a line number that still means what
#       it meant. Precise where it applies; blind to form B and to ambiguous
#       basenames, which is why [1] is not redundant with it.
#
# TWO KNOWN FALSE-POSITIVE DIRECTIONS, documented rather than fixed, because both
# are rare under the "delete the number, do not renumber it" discipline and both
# over-report (the lucky direction):
#
#   * check [2] scores citations found at `head` against content at `base`. A
#     citation ADDED or renumbered INSIDE the range therefore reads as rotted:
#     its line means something new because the citation is new, not because the
#     target moved. `--staged` / `--range` already gate that direction.
#   * `resolve_cited` strips a `library/` prefix. If a genuinely foreign path
#     happens to have an in-tree twin under the stripped name, it resolves to the
#     twin and check [2] compares against a file the citation never meant.
#
# WHAT A CLEAN RUN DOES NOT MEAN. Every report prints its own denominator, so a
# zero here is readable as "no rot among the citations this mode could RESOLVE"
# rather than "no rot". Ambiguous-basename citations are listed and deliberately
# do NOT affect the exit code -- over-reporting them would train the reader to
# ignore the section, and they cannot be adjudicated mechanically.
