"""tools/check_alloc.py — the alloc-guard (seam #6) gate wrapper.

Runs a binary under the mallocnesia LD_PRELOAD interceptor and exits nonzero if any
allocation is intercepted between the guard markers.

    python3 tools/check_alloc.py --binary <bin> [--mallocnesia <so>] [--max-allocs N]

fixpp#448 — WHAT CHANGED AND WHY IT IS NOT COSMETIC.

This wrapper used to FAIL OPEN. When it could not find the interceptor it printed
`WARNING: mallocnesia not found; running without allocation interception` and then
returned the binary's own exit code, so a clean run became `PASS: no unexpected
allocations detected`. No CI lane built the interceptor, so that was the path CI would
have taken had any lane run these gates at all.

Two independent failures had to be closed, because either alone still passes:

 1. THE INTERCEPTOR IS MISSING. Now fatal, unless --allow-missing is passed
    explicitly (local convenience only; never in CI).

 2. THE INTERCEPTOR IS PRESENT BUT NEVER LOADED. `LD_PRELOAD=/nonexistent/x.so` is
    NOT an error — ld.so prints "cannot be preloaded ... ignored" and runs the binary
    UNINSTRUMENTED, which exits 0. An exit code cannot tell that apart from a real
    pass, so this wrapper does not try: it requires the child to leave a WITNESS
    (MALLOCNESIA_WITNESS, written by the interceptor's constructor). No witness ⇒
    the gate did not run ⇒ FAIL, whatever the binary returned.

Measured before the fix: `LD_PRELOAD=/nonexistent/libmallocnesia.so
MALLOCNESIA_MAX_ALLOCS=0 log_alloc_test` prints the ld.so notice, then
`[  PASSED  ] 2 tests`, exit 0.

    # is missing or was never loaded. So on precisely the lane where interception has
    # broken — the case the control exists to detect — the control still passes.
    # That is `an arm whose forced defect stays green measures its own setup`.

    # demands all three: interception was ACTIVE (witness above), the binary FAILED, and
    # it failed for the RIGHT REASON (the interceptor said so). Any other combination is
