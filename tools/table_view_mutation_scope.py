"""Scope every mutated `table_view` declaration by BRACE DEPTH (fixpp#456).

For each `table_view X;` declaration it computes the enclosing brace scope, then
compares the line of the LAST mutator call on `X` against every non-mutator
mention of `X` inside that same scope. A scope where a read precedes the last
write INTERLEAVES and cannot be migrated by two mechanical lines.

    python3 tools/table_view_mutation_scope.py --root <library>
    python3 tools/table_view_mutation_scope.py --root <library> --emit-sites sites.tsv
    python3 tools/table_view_mutation_scope.py --root <library> --naive-decl-count

⚠️ SCOPING BY BRACE DEPTH IS THE WHOLE INSTRUMENT. The first version of this
script scanned whole FILES. It was wrong: in a file of many
`TEST(...) { table_view tv; ... }` blocks, test 1's reads of `tv` preceded test
2's writes to a DIFFERENT `tv`. Any figure produced by a file-scoped scan is a
fossil.

`--emit-sites` writes one TSV row per mutated declaration:

    <path>\\t<decl line>\\t<var>\\t<last mutator line>\\t<scope end line>\\t<interleaves>

That file — not a regex re-run across the tree — is what a migration should be
driven from. The obvious declaration regex `table_view X;` also rewrites
declarations that are never mutated, in TUs this census reports clean, which is
damage a tool CREATES rather than residue it leaves. `--naive-decl-count` prints
that regex's match count beside this scoper's; the two are printed as raw facts
and NOT compared, because the sets are not nested in either direction (see the
ATTRIBUTION GUARD below — the scoper sees `auto` spellings the naive regex
cannot, while the naive regex sees never-mutated declarations the scoper skips).

⚠️ THE ATTRIBUTION GUARD IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE INSTRUMENT, and it exists
because a DECLARATION-shaped census has a declaration-shaped blind spot. The
site table above is the sole driver of the migration, so a mutator call it does
not attribute is a call nobody rewrites. After every scan, EVERY mutator-call
line in every scanned file must fall inside the scope of a declaration this
script found; an unattributed receiver is printed and exits non-zero unless it
is named on `--known-unscoped path:var`. The known shapes are the ones where the
reference IS the mutation channel and there is no named local to rename (a
`table_view&` parameter or lambda argument) — those are migrated by hand, so
they are allow-listed explicitly rather than by widening the declaration regex.

⚠️ What "attributed" does NOT prove. Attribution is by (variable name, brace
scope), so a call attributed to a same-named declaration in a sibling scope
counts as attributed. The guard catches a receiver NO declaration explains; it
does not adjudicate which declaration explains it. The builder column shares
this same (variable name, brace scope) machinery with the declaration column
above it, not a bare file-wide name set — the two concede the identical
sibling-scope residue.

Self-check, on the ATTRIBUTION GUARD (both columns print on every run, so
neither can be assumed): proven able to report non-zero (an unattributed
receiver is printed by name and the run exits non-zero unless it is named on
`--known-unscoped`) AND able to report zero (a receiver attributed to a scoped
declaration is counted, not printed). The DECLARATION CENSUS's own two-sidedness
is CONDITIONAL, not a standing property: post-migration every mutator call is on
a `table_view_builder`, so the census runs over an empty population and its zero
is evidence of nothing. Re-derive both counts with a fresh run; do not trust a
figure pasted here.
