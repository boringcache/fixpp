"""Measure the compile-time blast radius of the fixpp#456 `table_view` seal.

Writes a SIMULATED sealed `table_view.hpp` into a scratch include root (the
sixteen mutators moved behind `private:` plus `friend class table_view_builder;`,
both assignment operators `= delete`, the `is_nothrow_move_assignable_v`
static_assert dropped), puts that root FIRST on the include path, and re-runs
every TU in a configured build's `compile_commands.json` with `-fsyntax-only
-ferror-limit=0`.

    python3 tools/table_view_seal_sweep.py \
        --root <library> --build build/linux-clang-debug \
        --filter /src/ --arm differential --scratch /abs/path/to/scratch

ARMS
  --arm control       identical command WITHOUT the scratch root
  --arm sealed        the measurement
  --arm differential  runs both and prints the SET DIFFERENCE (sealed minus
                      control). The differential is this tool's output, not
                      arithmetic performed in prose afterwards.

WHY THIS SCRIPT IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS — every guard below exists because the
corresponding failure was OBSERVED, and each one fails LOUD rather than clean:

  1. `--scratch` is resolved with `os.path.abspath`, and a scratch include root
     that does not exist or is empty is a hard failure. TUs are compiled with
     `cwd=<build dir>`, so a RELATIVE `--scratch` resolves against the build
     directory and points at nothing — and clang ignores a nonexistent `-I`
     SILENTLY. The sealed arm then degrades into a bit-for-bit rerun of the
     control and reports zero errors. The control pairing cannot catch that: a
     degraded sealed arm agrees with the control perfectly, which is exactly
     what the pairing checks for.

  2. The sealed arm ASSERTS a seeded-`#error` shadow witness before it measures
     anything. A number produced by a run that did not shadow the header is not
     emitted at all: "0 errors" and "the overlay never reached the include path"
     are otherwise the same observation.

     ⚠️ The control arm runs the same check for the OPPOSITE outcome, and that
     half is weaker on purpose — say what it is. The control injects no `-I`, so
     the token is unreachable and the assertion cannot fail on any *input*. It is
     a SCRIPT-level regression guard, not evidence about a run: it fires if the
     `-I` injection ever becomes unconditional, which would silently make the
     control a second sealed arm and drive the differential to zero. Read it as
     a guard on this file, never as two-sided evidence for a measurement.

  3. The witness TU is chosen by a dependency scan, and a filter that selects no
     TU including `table_view.hpp` is a hard failure — a vacuous sweep cannot
     report a plausible zero.

  4. `EXPECTED_CONTROL_FAILURES` binds the repo's must-fail negative-compile
     probes to their intended diagnostics — the dict below is the authority on
     how many there are. The control arm
     passes on IDENTITY, not on count: a listed probe that fails differently, a
     listed probe that stops failing, and any unlisted control failure are all
     fatal. In the sealed arm a listed probe carrying any diagnostic other than
     its bound one is fatal too, so a probe that additionally acquired a seal
     error cannot be absorbed by a subtraction.

  5. `-ferror-limit=0` is load-bearing. clang stops at a default error limit, so
     a run without it turns a census into a ceiling wearing the costume of a
     count — every heavily-hit TU would report the same plausible number.

  6. The scratch root must PRECEDE the build's own `-I`. It is injected ahead of
     every flag the compile database carries.

  7. EVERY compilation carries its RETURN CODE, and the classifier is not
     allowed to decide alone. `rc == 0` with no classified `": error:"`
     diagnostic is the ONLY clean state. `rc != 0` with nothing classified is
     fatal, printing the return code and the head of stderr — that is a driver
     `fatal error:` (whose ` error:` is preceded by a SPACE, not by a colon, so
     the classifier's pattern cannot see it), a signal death, or an ICE. `rc ==
     0` with something classified is fatal too: the two halves disagree and a
     census must not choose between them. The dependency probe in
     `pick_witness()` checks `rc` for the same reason — a failed `-MM` reads as
     "this TU does not include table_view.hpp" otherwise, which moves the
     witness silently and can raise the WRONG fatal ("this sweep is vacuous")
     for a broken probe.

SCOPE. This is the PRE-implementation bill instrument: it simulates the seal by
rewriting a header that is not yet sealed. Once the seal has actually landed the
anchors below are gone and the script HARD-FAILS with a named message rather
than silently producing a control-shaped run. Validating a completed migration
is the job of an ordinary full build of the migrated tree, not of this script.

    # "did a failure go unreported?", and here the failure IS reported — a crash
    # after one diagnostic still lands the TU in `bad`. The condition being watched
    # is satisfied by something OTHER than the thing it was written for, which is
    # the spurious HIT. Every mutant written for guard 7 forces a miss, so the
    # mutants for THIS guard must force a hit: an abnormal rc (or a crash banner)
    # arriving WITH a classified diagnostic.
    #
    # The cost is truncation: a run that died part-way emitted only the diagnostics
    # it reached, so the per-TU error count — and the `total errors` figure summed
    # from it — is short by an unknown amount, and a must-fail probe can satisfy
    # its manifest entry on a bound diagnostic it emitted before dying.
