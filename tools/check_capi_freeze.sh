# check_capi_freeze.sh — NBC-1 (T017): the C-ABI surface is BYTE-FROZEN.
#
# The 0->1 GA freeze (FR-012 / SC-007) means no C-ABI header changes without a
# reviewed manifest edit. Before fixpp's first public release that is review
# discipline, not a compatibility promise ([const §X.7]).
# This gate recomputes the SHA-256 of `include/fix/c_api.h` + every header under
# `include/fix/c_api/` and verifies it against the committed manifest
# `tools/capi_freeze.sha256`. It is event-independent (works on push:main where
# there is no PR base to diff against) — "byte-frozen" is an ABSOLUTE baseline,
# not a relative-to-base diff.
#
# ANY content change to a frozen header fails the `sha256sum -c` check; ANY
# added/removed header fails the exact-set check below. Deliberately unfreezing
# the C-ABI (any C-ABI change, including a pre-release MINOR per [const §X.7])
# is therefore a visible, reviewed edit to the
# manifest in the same PR — which is the point.
#
# Companion to the existing tools/check_capi_occupancy.sh (the C-ABI occupancy
# gate run alongside this one in tier1.yml check-layers / python-wheel).
