# check_dictionary_snapshot_exclusivity.sh — fixpp#215 item 1 (Option C),
# `.specify/215-dictionary-view.md` §6 seam 7, v0.4; G2 as amended by
# `.specify/495-493-486-dict-reify-copy.md` §6.4 (fixpp#495, owner ruling R-C).
#
#   G1 — `snapshot_key` (the passkey) is minted by exactly ONE production
#        function: fixpp::dict::make_dictionary_snapshot. Load-bearing for
#        Option C's C1 closure and not expressible as a static_assert.
#   G2 — a SPELLING LINT: ZERO matches, tree-wide, of the enumerated
#        two-argument `shared_ptr<const ... table_view>(` spellings (the
#        aliasing constructor). The snapshot owns its table in the table's own
#        control block (fixpp#495 D-4), so no production code forms an alias.
#        G2 claims nothing about aliasing constructions it does not spell; the
#        PROPERTY (a handle or clone never keeps the Dictionary alive) is
#        witnessed behaviourally by the C++ Session twin of the design note's
#        T-13 and by T-19. tools/test_dictionary_snapshot_exclusivity_gate.sh
#        seeds each spelling and requires `G2 FAIL`.
#
# This is a source gate mirrored by the Tier-1 workflow and recorded manually
# in the 215 `/speckit-verify` evidence doc; it is NOT wired through the same
# path as `check_capi_freeze.sh`. The text layer now runs a small stateful
# comment lexer: it strips `//...` and `/* ... */` comments across lines while
# preserving code before/after a comment and ignoring comment markers inside
# ordinary and raw string literals. It is still a text gate, not a C++ parser:
# this script counts literal spellings and the G2 pattern remains limited to
# the enumerated shared_ptr spellings below. Every grep is guarded with
# `|| true`: under `set -e` + `pipefail` an unguarded grep that matches nothing
# aborts the WHOLE gate on its own PASSING branch (this project's recorded
# `[ cond ] && fail` trap, pipeline form) — see the design doc §6 seam 7 for
# the worked example that shipped broken this way on first draft.
