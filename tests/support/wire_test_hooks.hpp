// FIXPP_TEST_HOOKS; see that header for the rationale). Given a ROOT table,
// resolves the sub-table already cached for
// `(slice_data, hooks.opaque_dict(), nested_no_tag)` in
// `nested_cache_`, or `nullptr` if no matching row exists (never requested,
// OR the row's build itself failed — research.md §D2 mode (a)). Does NOT
// trigger a build: the caller must already have invoked
// `nested_group_slices(slice_data, ..., nested_no_tag, ...)` once so the row
// exists. Never called from production code. The definition itself is gated
// behind FIXPP_TEST_HOOKS so it never attempts to access the (now ungranted)
// private OffsetTable::nested_cache_ member in a non-test-hooks build.

// 389: `reserve_bound_access_for_testing` was DELETED here along with
// `OffsetTable::group_slices_reserve_bound()` itself. There is no reservation
// estimate left to read — each group allocates exactly its own slice count.
//
// Deleting this hook is PART of the instrument for the change, the same trick
// #384 used with the constructor defaults: every test that read the estimator
// becomes a COMPILE ERROR rather than something a grep has to find. It named
// three — W-10 probe 3, the hostile-input clamp cell, and an anti-vacuity guard
// on the bad_alloc degrade.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT WAS NOT THE WHOLE POPULATION, which is the more useful half.
// `WireOffsetTable.TwoTopLevelGroupsSpanStableAcrossReads` also depended on the
// estimator — its entire rationale and its named mutation were the reserve —
// but it never READ the hook, only the shared-vector SHAPE. A compile error
// cannot find a dependency on a shape. It was found by grep, and an earlier
// version of this comment claimed the compiler "named exactly three" while a
// fourth stood a directory away.
//
// The rule that generalises: removing a symbol enumerates the sites that NAME
// it, never the sites that depend on the STRUCTURE it was part of. Use both,
// and do not let the compiler's precision imply completeness. See B&L B-389-1.
