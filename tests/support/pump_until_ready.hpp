// Bounded pumps for manually-driven io_contexts, and the teardown guard their
// failure path requires.
//
// Hoisted (issue #284) from tests/session/logout_exchange_test.cpp, which
// introduced `pump_until_ready` for exactly this defect. Parameterised on the
// way out, because it is the seventh member of a family that had each solved
// the same problem separately and incompatibly — see issue #289's sibling-
// helper census, alongside #289(a)'s census of raw
// `run_for(W); restart(); get()` sites that have no helper at all.

// so zeroing the BUDGET does not force a miss at a site whose predicate already holds
// at entry -- the loop is skipped, `done` is true, and the arm reports `[ OK ]` rather
// than announcing anything. Forcing such a site by hand needs TWO coordinated edits
// (starve the predicate as well as the budget) and getting only the obvious one reads
// as a pass. MEASURED on the two `test_019_g2_enablement_witness.cpp` sites, which
// passed under a budget-only mutation.

// below is the scope-guard form that covers ASSERT_*'s early return.
//
// This obligation binds callers whose coroutine input is NOT already outlived
// by the pump's own scope (e.g. a block-scoped buffer passed by span into the

//     which spells the same anchor `TAIL=`.
//   * NOT by ONE fragment. Drivers bind the TAIL, matchers bind the HEAD; each probe
//     finds its own half and reports the other half as absent.
//   * NOT with `git grep`. Every #289 batch adds an untracked red-arm script that carries
//     the tail, so a tracked-files-only search fails toward clean over exactly the files
//     the batch is adding, at exactly the moment someone runs it.

// then ambiguous with a real `open()` / `on_inbound_frame()` outcome ([2d §6.5];
// the `dispatch_aborted` returns in `Session::live_write_serialized_`), so an
// assertion on the error could be satisfied by this synthetic one. The remedy at

// and belongs nowhere in this comment):
//
//     comm -12 \
//       <(git grep -l kWindowMissSentinel -- tests/ | grep -v pump_until_ready.hpp | sort) \
//       <(git grep -lE 'EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE|ScopedFakeTestPartResultReporter|gtest-spi' \
//              -- tests/ | sort)
//
// The precondition holds while that intersection is EMPTY, transitively through
// includes.
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE MUST BE EXCLUDED FROM THE ADOPTER SIDE, and the first version of
// this recipe was not — it reported a hit on the very first run. This header
// appears in BOTH lists for reasons that are not adoption: it DEFINES the
// constant, and the paragraph above NAMES the interceptor macros in prose. A
// recipe that flags its own documentation cries wolf on every future run, which
// is how a real hit gets waved through.
//
// ⚠️ Do not `head` either list — this is a claim about a whole SET, and truncating
// one side is how a set-difference reports clean. The interceptor grep is proven
// able to fire (it returns several files today), so an empty intersection is a
// measurement rather than a broken pattern.
//
// Hoisted here from three call-site files (#324's `send_path_test.cpp`,
// `tc_establishment_test.cpp`, `tc_seqnum_test.cpp`), which each carried a

// reason `kDrainResidual` was -- a fragment duplicated in two places drifts, and
// this one is four times longer than the stem that had already drifted on
// punctuation at birth.
//
// Byte-identity of the hoist is INTACT, measured against origin/main: `drain_or_report`'s
// composed message is 327 bytes at base and at HEAD, byte-for-byte identical, and
// `cancel_and_drain_or_report`'s composed message is identical through byte 421 -- the
// only difference is inside the tail this PR deliberately rewrote. So the hoist changed
// no byte any matcher can see. ⚠️ Splitting this fragment back into each producer
// (undoing the hoist) would make it genuinely unbound, but at the cost of re-duplicating
// "so a coroutine frame" across two producers -- exactly the drift this hoist exists to
// remove, in a stem this file already records above as having drifted on punctuation at
// birth once already. Not adopted for that reason; see below for what is actually bound.
//
// ⚠️ BYTES IN THIS CONSTANT ARE WITNESS-BOUND. That is the whole claim, and it is
// deliberately the whole claim: this comment records NO cached answer about WHICH bytes,
// which matchers, or how many. Four rounds of Gate B review each found a different such
// answer to be false, every one of them written by the round that had just deleted the

// zero bytes of this constant. Nothing about the message shapes REQUIRES a matcher to
// carry into this text; whether any does is a property of how the matchers happen to be
// written, and is therefore a thing to measure, not to remember.
//
// To measure it: mutate the bytes you care about, rebuild `session_pure_tests`, run the
// WHOLE binary with no `--gtest_filter`, and -- before believing a green -- confirm the
// mutated bytes are actually in the built binary, e.g.
// `strings build/linux-clang-asan/bin/session_pure_tests | grep`. That last step is not

// shipped that third copy with the #305 deadline artefact reintroduced, caught
// only because the two siblings carried a zero-budget witness it lacked.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT REMAINS IS NOT A COUNT TO KEEP DRIVING DOWN, and stating it as one
// ("two copies, not three") invites the next reader to try for one. The
// CONDITION: there is one drain per DRAIN ALGORITHM. `drain_or_report` is a
// single full-budget `run_for`; `cancel_and_drain_or_report` is a 1 ms-sliced
// loop that re-cancels sleeps every pass. Neither is a copy of the other -- they
// share only a `try` / `pump_or_report_throw` / `if (!ioc.stopped())` skeleton
// whose exception half is ALREADY factored out into this function. Folding them
// would impose the sliced loop's per-call floor on `drain_or_report`'s callers,
// which is the objection `run_window_then_ready` above already accepted against
// adopting `pump_until_ready`'s floor. A third drain is warranted only by a third
// algorithm, and a duplicated one never is.
//
// WHY A DRAIN NEEDS THIS AT ALL. Pumping dispatches arbitrary ready handlers, and
// a handler may throw. `~quiesce_on_exit` has no exception specification and no
// exception handling, so it is implicitly `noexcept` and an escaping exception is
// `std::terminate` -- no gtest failure, no test name, and no indication of which
// guard died, which is strictly LESS diagnosable than the `ADD_FAILURE` the guard
// exists to produce. `drain_or_report` is not itself `noexcept`, but it is called
// from destructor BODIES (`~Fixture` in tests/session/test_next_expected_msgseqnum.cpp), so
// the exception meets an implicitly-noexcept frame one level up and terminates
// just the same.
//
// The exception TEXT is preserved deliberately: swallowing it would trade a
// terminate for a silent pass, which is worse than either.
//
// ⚠️ This is NOT `quiesce_or_release_on_exit`'s shape (added by #304, in
// test_test_request_id_cross_session_race.cpp), and it must not be conflated with
// it. That guard's catch is nested so that an exception mid-pump still takes the
// RELEASE branch -- it exists to fail SAFE. "Do not lose the release" and "do not
// terminate" are different requirements; `~InteropEngineFixture`
// (interop_fixture.cpp's `~InteropEngineFixture()`) records that collapsing them
// into one outer catch was itself a defect. This helper has no release branch to
// lose, so a single catch is correct HERE and would not be correct THERE.

// Run a caller's ORIGINAL fixed window, then report whether `fut` is ready.
//
// This is the #289 migration shape, and it is NOT `pump_until_ready`. The two
// differ on purpose:
//
//   - No work guard. `pump_until` takes one (its `wg = asio::make_work_guard(ioc)`)
//     so `run_for` cannot drain early, which is what gives that helper its
//     documented COST FLOOR (`kPumpSlice`'s doc comment above:
//     "1 ms slice = 124 ms" over 106 calls, ~1.17 ms/call). The #289 sites were
//     measured at ~27 us, so adopting that floor would be a ~40x per-call
//     regression at 32 sites. Here `run_for` keeps its normal early-drain
//     behaviour and the window costs what it costs today.
//   - The window is PRESERVED, not sliced. A site's first transition to Active
//     co_spawns a DETACHED `run_liveness_loop()` (src/session/session.cpp,
//     on both the acceptor and the initiator path), and `co_spawn` POSTS its first resumption, so
//     it lands on a LATER `run_one_until`. An early-exit pump that stopped at
//     future-readiness would leave that detached task unserviced; running the
//     original window to drain-or-deadline services it exactly as today.
//
// What it DOES take from `pump_until_ready` is the load-bearing property in
// its own doc comment — the caller must consult the bool BEFORE `fut.get()`. `[[nodiscard]]`
// puts a compiler DIAGNOSTIC on ignoring it, rather than leaving it to a
// reviewer or a lexical checker. Whether that diagnostic is an ERROR depends on the
// build, so do not describe it as compiler-ENFORCED unconditionally: with
// `FIXPP_WERROR=ON`, `fixpp_apply_werror_to_all_targets` (cmake/Helpers.cmake) adds
// `-Werror` to every compiled target, tests included; with it OFF it stays a warning.
// ⚠️ Re-derive which presets set the option from CMakePresets.json rather than trusting
// a list here -- this paragraph has been wrong twice, once naming a moved LINE NUMBER
// and once calling the blanket plumbing dead after it was wired (#417). The targeted
// `-Werror=deprecated-declarations` WILL_FAIL probes are exempt from the blanket flag;
// `grep -rn Werror` over the build files is the derivation.
//
// The grace slice is not a "CI tolerance" and must not be grown into one.
// `run_one_until` tests `now < abs_time` BEFORE dispatching (see `pump_until`'s
// doc comment above), so a handler that became ready at the instant the window
// closed is left QUEUED.
// One `kPumpSlice` gives exactly that handler a dispatch opportunity. It moves
// the deadline by one slice; it does not make a slow runner safe, and no
// statically-chosen value could.
//
// A false return means the awaited coroutine is still SUSPENDED holding
// whatever the caller passed it. The caller MUST then drain while that state is
// still alive — see `drain_or_report` and its warning about storage that is not
// a fixture member.
//
// ── THE SITE-KEYED FORCING SEAM (optional `site`) ────────────────────────────
//
// Passing a site label opts the call into RUNTIME forcing: exporting
// `FIXPP_FORCE_WINDOW_MISS=<label>` makes exactly that site take its miss branch,
// with no source edit and no rebuild.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Verifying a migrated site means proving its miss branch actually
// reports, which means forcing a miss. The textual driver (`ci/pump-red-arm.sh`)
// does that by rewriting the source and rebuilding ONCE PER SITE, because forcing
// every site at once does not work: the first miss on a code path returns and masks
// every later site on it (PR #316 forced fifteen and covered seven). At batch-11
// scale that is one full rebuild per site. Here it is one build and N runs.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS A WEAKER WITNESS THAN TEXTUAL MUTATION, AND DOES NOT REPLACE IT. State the
// difference precisely -- this paragraph has been wrong in BOTH directions, once
// overstating the seam and once understating it, so re-derive it from the code below
// rather than trusting the sentence:
//   IT DOES exercise the SITE'S OWN miss block -- forcing returns false, so the caller's
//     `if (!run_window_then_ready(...))` body always runs, drain and report included.
//   ⚠️ EVERYTHING BELOW IS CONDITIONAL ON THE SITE'S STATE AT ENTRY, because FORCING
//     PRESERVES WHATEVER STATE EXISTS -- IT CANNOT MANUFACTURE ONE. Three separate claims
//     here have been written unconditionally and been false at the same site for the same
//     reason; state the condition or do not state the claim.
//   IT DOES reproduce a real miss's STATE *WHERE THE FUTURE WAS NOT YET READY WHEN THE
//     WINDOW OPENED*: forcing does not dispatch, so the frame is still suspended when the
//     miss branch runs and the DRAIN is what resumes it -- which is the lifetime obligation
//     (see (b) at the definition below). Where the future was ALREADY READY before the
//     window opened there is no suspended frame, the drain resumes nothing, and no forcing
//     mode can change that. `LO_InboundLogout_Confirm/close` is such a site, and
//     `ci/red-arms/batch12-spotcheck.tsv` records it as the batch's measured exception.
//   IT DOES NOT exercise the primitive's own pumping path: a forced call dispatches
//     nothing. It DOES call `ioc.restart()` before returning, which is the one thing a
//     genuine miss leaves behind that a bare early return would not -- so a miss branch
//     that pumps before it drains behaves the same under forcing as for real. An earlier
//     revision of this line said "a forced call never touches the io_context" and paired
//     it with "nothing in this tree depends on that"; the second half was a survey, and
//     the first stopped being true when the restart was added for the budget primitive.
//   IT DOES NOT judge the drain FLAVOUR, and NEITHER DRIVER'S FORCING MODE CHANGES THAT.
//     Which drain a site needs is a quiescence question the ANNOUNCEMENT cannot see. The
//     textual driver can catch a wrong flavour, because `ci/pump-red-arm.sh` fails an arm
//     whose drain reports a residual -- but that power comes from the FLAVOUR alone.
//     ⚠️ REASON, not a case list, because a case list invites a hunt for a case it missed:
//     BOTH drains are strictly LONGER pumps than the window they follow (`drain_or_report`
//     is `restart(); run_for(5s); poll_one()`; the clocked one is a 5 s sliced loop). So
//     zeroing DEFERS work into the drain rather than withholding it, and the residual
//     verdict reads the FIXED POINT -- what is still outstanding once pumping stops --
//     which both a zeroed and an unzeroed arm reach. An earlier revision of this line said
//     the residual check "has power only because forcing does not dispatch; the two are
//     coupled". False: the only thing surviving either pump is a mock-clock waiter, and a
//     real window cannot release one either. The zeroing and this check are independent.
//
//     ⚠️ WHEN THE FLAVOUR IS LIVE, since half this tree's sites could use either drain and
//     nothing said so. `cancel_and_drain_or_report` earns its `cancel_sleeps()` iff a
//     MOCK-CLOCK WAITER can be registered by the time the drain runs. In this tree that is
//     AMBIENT work, not the awaited frame: `run_liveness_loop` is co-spawned on the first
//     transition to Active and parks on a `heartbeat_interval` deadline. So the flavour
//     matters where the fixture sets a NON-ZERO `heartbeat_interval` AND the site is
//     reached at or after Active; where the fixture sets 0 there is no liveness loop and
//     the two drains are behaviourally identical. Derive it from the fixture's config, not
//     from what the awaited coroutine happens to be blocked on -- that question is the
//     wrong one and answering it suggests, falsely, that the clocked drain is decorative.
//
//     ⚠️ AND THE FLAVOUR IS NOT ALWAYS THE ANSWER, because a mock-clock waiter is only ONE
//     of the two things a pump cannot release. Pumping alone reaches everything EXCEPT
//     (i) a mock-clock waiter, released only by `cancel_sleeps()` -- the flavour; and
//     (ii) an op that never completes on its own, e.g. a coroutine parked in
//     `async_write`/`async_read_some` on a LIVE TRANSPORT, which no amount of pumping and
//     no `cancel_sleeps()` will end.
//     ⚠️ THE REMEDY FOR (ii) IS "CLOSE WHATEVER MAKES THE PARKED OP FAIL", WHICH IS NOT
//     ALWAYS THAT OP'S OWNER, and the list below reads as if it were. Batch 14's case (ii)
//     closes a THIRD object: the parked op is a client TLS handshake whose transport the
//     coroutine MOVED IN and the test cannot reach, so the site closes the ACCEPTOR and the
//     peer's handshake fails for want of a server. Admit the indirect form when reading the
//     list; "close the owner" is the common case, not the rule.
//     For (ii) the usual answer is the transport-aware drain
//     (`cancel_and_drain_or_report` with a transport, or `quiesce_on_exit` with `.transport`
//     set), NOT a different clock argument. `ci/pump-red-arm.sh` says "Check the drain
//     FLAVOUR at this site" on a residual, which points at (i) only; if a residual survives
//     BOTH clock flavours, it is (ii). No #289 batch-12 site reaches (ii) -- the three
//     clock-free files use a `MinimalTransportFactory` with no parking transport -- so this
//     is written to be found rather than rediscovered.
//     ⚠️ BATCH 13 REACHED (ii), so the sentence above is a record of batch 12 and not a
//     standing property. `test_019_g2_enablement_witness.cpp`'s two send sites park on a
//     live loopback-TLS transport, and the single-`Transport*` overload does not fit
//     there: the engine owns two sessions plus a listener, and the parameter takes one.
//     What those sites do instead is the remaining answer -- close the transport first,
//     which at engine level spells `engine.stop()` -- bounded, verdict ignored, drain
//     after. That sequence is currently spelled out at both sites rather than factored
//     into a helper here, deliberately: two call sites in one file is a coincidence, and
//     a helper would also collapse them onto one gtest file:line.
//     ⚠️ A SECOND FILE NOW EXISTS AND IT DOES **NOT** DISCHARGE THE GRADUATION CONDITION,
//     because the LEVER differs. #289 batch 14's
//     `MakeAcceptedAdoptsRealAcceptedSocketAndHandshakes/accept`
//     (`tests/transport/test_transport_factory_paths.cpp`) is the same SHAPE -- close the
//     owner of the live op inside another await's miss branch -- but what it closes is a
//     bare `asio::ip::tcp::acceptor`, not an engine. Two instances, two different closers.
//     That is exactly the parameter a premature primitive would have to guess, and the
//     note above already records the last guess failing: the single-`Transport*` overload
//     did not fit batch 13's site. So the condition is restated as a CONDITION rather than
//     a count: **graduate when the SAME LEVER is needed in a SECOND FILE.**
//     ⚠️ NOT "when a lever recurs" -- an earlier wording said that and it was ALREADY
//     DISCHARGED on its own terms: `engine.stop()` appears three times in
//     `test_019_g2_enablement_witness.cpp` alone, and the paragraph four lines above this
//     one says two call sites in ONE file is a coincidence. Both halves are load-bearing:
//     the same lever, in a different file.
//
//     ⚠️ WHICH SITES CAN REACH (ii) AT ALL has a sharper predicate than "is a live
//     transport involved", and batch 14 measured it: of 31 forced sites across five files
//     that ALL hold a live transport, exactly one left a residual. The discriminator is
//     whether the counterparty is driveable BY THE PUMP ALONE. Where the far side is a
//     self-contained detached coroutine (accept, then handshake, needing nothing from the
//     test body), the drain is a longer pump than the window and simply finishes the
//     exchange. Where the TEST BODY is a required step -- factory-paths hands the accepted
//     socket back through `.get()` and only then builds the server transport, so a miss
//     returns before the server side exists -- the peer's handshake waits for someone who
//     will never arrive. In the FORCED state only that second shape reached (ii).
//     ⚠️ THAT IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT A PROPERTY, and the difference decides whether you may
//     skip a site. Forcing PRESERVES the state at entry, so nothing had dispatched and the
//     whole exchange ran fresh inside the drain. Under a REAL miss the window already ran,
//     so a self-contained peer may have ALREADY returned or errored -- leaving the client
//     parked with nobody left to drive it, i.e. (ii), at a site this predicate excludes.
//     The predicate says which sites reached (ii) under forcing; it does not bound which
//     sites can reach it. [[feedback_a_survey_presented_as_a_property_re_arms_itself]]
//     ⚠️ That measurement is bounded by how forcing works: it PRESERVES the state at entry,
//     so it witnesses the drain against a HEALTHY exchange not yet dispatched, which is the
//     opposite of the wedged exchange a real miss implies.
//     [[feedback_a_forcing_mechanism_cannot_manufacture_the_state_it_preserves]]
//
//     ⚠️ WHAT A RESIDUAL VERDICT MEANS, WRITTEN ONCE HERE because both arm drivers used to
//     paraphrase it and the two paraphrases drifted apart -- one told the reader to check
//     the drain FLAVOUR only, which is survivor case (i) and cannot fix a case (ii) at all.
//     Both now point here instead of restating. A residual means the miss branch reported
//     AND the drain did not quiesce, so ask, in order: is a MOCK-CLOCK waiter outstanding
//     (case (i) -- change the flavour), or is an op parked on something no pump ends
//     (case (ii) -- close whatever makes it fail, per the paragraph above; a flavour change
//     cannot fix that one). If a residual survives BOTH clock flavours, it is (ii).
//
//     ⚠️ GRADUATION CONDITION, so this is a decision and not an oversight: promote
//     "stop the engine, then drain" to a primitive next to `cancel_and_drain_or_report`
//     when a SECOND FILE needs THAT LEVER. Enumerate the candidates, then RESOLVE EACH BY
//     HAND -- this is not a count, and a grep cannot decide it:
//       git grep -n -B6 'engine.stop(), asio::use_future' -- tests/ ':!tests/support/*'
//     ⚠️ THE DISCRIMINATOR, because the common shape out-numbers this one and a loose
//     grep reports both: in the ORDINARY shape `engine.stop()` IS the awaited future and
//     the drain is its own miss branch -- that is most of this tree and is NOT this case.
//     This case is `engine.stop()` spawned as a REMEDY *inside* the miss branch of some
//     OTHER await, to close a transport the drain cannot. Look at what the enclosing
//     `if (!...)` is guarding, not at the two lines being adjacent.
// Use the seam for breadth and textual mutation to spot-check recipe correctness.
// Do not retire `ci/pump-red-arm.sh`.
//
// ⚠️ SILENCE IS AMBIGUOUS, WHICH IS WHY FORCING ANNOUNCES ITSELF. A run that produces
// no `kWindowMiss` report can mean the seam fired and the miss branch failed to
// report, or that the label matched NOTHING (a typo, a site that passes no label, or
// a site the run never reached) -- the same empty output from opposite causes, with
// the second failing toward clean. So a firing seam writes `kWindowMissForced` +
// the label to stderr BEFORE returning. A driver MUST require that line and
// treat its absence as "no such site", never as a silent pass.
// [[feedback_every_broken_instrument_in_this_repo_fails_toward_clean]]
//
// ⚠️ ADOPTION IS INCREMENTAL AND THE PARAMETER IS DEFAULTED, SO "the seam can force
// any site" IS FALSE. It forces only sites that pass a label. Sites migrated before
// the seam existed pass none and are reachable only through textual mutation. Derive
// which sites are forceable -- do not assume a batch's whole population is.
//
// The label is not new text: it already exists at every migrated site, as the operand
// of `ADD_FAILURE() << kWindowMiss << "<Site>"`. Adopting the seam relocates that
// literal into the call; it does not invent an identity.
//
// COST, because this primitive rejected an alternative on exactly this ground. The doc
// above records the ~1 ms-slice shape being refused as a ~40x per-call regression against
// sites measured at ~27 us. What the seam adds on a labelled call is one pointer compare,
// one acquire load on the magic static, and a `strcmp` only when the env var is set at all.
// Measured 2026-09-04 (clang -O2, this code shape, 50M iterations): **~0.6 ns/call**, i.e.
// ~0.002 % of that budget. An UNLABELLED call -- every site from batches 1-10 -- pays the
// pointer compare and nothing else.
// ⚠️ Re-derive rather than trusting the figure: it is a measurement of a code shape on one
// box, and the load-bearing claim is the RATIO to the ~27 us site cost, not the nanoseconds.

    //       TemporaryAlive` (tests/session/test_next_expected_msgseqnum.cpp) passes ZERO for
    //       BOTH durations and its comment records why -- a zero window alone does not miss,

    //       ready. That is this property, checked in and proven RED.
    //       ⚠️ AND NOTE WHAT (b) DOES *NOT* BUY, because an earlier revision of this comment
    //       claimed it: it does not improve the odds of catching a wrong drain FLAVOUR. That
    //       needs a CLOCK-BOUND frame, and a real window does not advance a mock clock, so
    //       such a frame stays suspended whether the window ran or not.
    //       An intermediate revision DID run the window, to close a blind spot ("a miss
    //       branch that depends on the restarts having happened"), and that blind spot is
    //       HYPOTHETICAL: both drains call `ioc.restart()` themselves before pumping.
    //       Traded a real witness for a hypothetical one; reverted.
    //
    // The io_context is therefore left UNDISPATCHED, deliberately, per (b) and its last
    // sentence -- but not untouched: the forced path calls `ioc.restart()`, which is what a

// At a caller-side site the miss is a scheduling question and every enclosing driver
// still gets to run. Here the blocking `get()` executes ON the pumping thread, from
// inside the handler the driver dispatched, so it wedges the driver too:
//
//     tests/sync/test_drain_predrain_holder.cpp  -- a 5 s deadline loop around
//         `ioc.run_for(100ms)`; the 100 ms call never returns, so the deadline is
//         never re-tested and `ASSERT_FALSE(timed_out)` is never reached.
//     tests/sync/test_pool_exhaustion_reuse.cpp  -- `run_to_exhaustion_or_report`
//         and `pump_until_ready`; both are pumping when the coroutine blocks.
//
// So a bounded outer driver, which is the #289 remedy everywhere else, does NOT bound
// this shape. The whole binary hangs and ctest reports a timeout naming no site.
// Re-derive rather than trusting the two names above: they are illustrations of the
// mechanism, and the mechanism is what holds -- any driver, of any shape, is inside a
// dispatched handler when the coroutine it dispatched calls `get()`.
// MEASURED, not read off asio: `ci/red-arms/batch19-coroutine-side-get.sh` runs both
// shapes under a defect no yielding can fix and shows the unguarded one WEDGE.
//
// THE WINDOW IS PRESERVED, exactly as in `run_window_then_ready`: `window` yields are
// issued unconditionally, so a site that used `co_await yield_n(N)` for its own
// interleaving semantics keeps every one of those N yields. The guard adds a ready
// check and a bounded grace after them; it never shortens the window.
//
// IT REPORTS ITSELF, like `run_to_exhaustion_or_report` and unlike
// `run_window_then_ready`. The discriminator between those two is what the miss branch
// still owes: `run_window_then_ready`'s callers owe a SITE-SPECIFIC teardown (a
// `cancel_and_drain_or_report` with that fixture's Clock) which no primitive can supply,
// so the report stays with them. A miss here owes nothing -- teardown belongs to the
// outer driver, which is still holding the context -- so leaving the `ADD_FAILURE` at
// the call would only spell the site label a second time, by hand, at every site.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE `ADD_FAILURE` CONDITIONS THIS FILE MANDATES DO NOT TRANSFER VERBATIM HERE,
// so they are restated rather than inherited. `drain_or_report`'s header states them for
// a plain function: safe while (a) it sits in a frame that may throw and (b) no enclosing
// `catch (...)` stands between it and the frame that should receive the throw. An
// AWAITABLE frame does not RECEIVE a throw. Under `--gtest_throw_on_failure` the
// exception is captured by the coroutine promise, re-thrown at the caller's `co_await`,
// propagated into the outer `use_future`, and surfaced at the test body's `f.get()` --
// so neither this `co_return false` nor the site's `co_return;` ever runs, and the
// FAILURE IS STILL LOUD but arrives at a different place than a reader of (a)/(b) would
// predict. `run_to_exhaustion_or_report` is not a coroutine and does not settle this.
//
// THE CONDITION, stated so it does not rot into a count of today's callers:
//     No `catch (...)` may stand between a `co_await` of this guard and the outer
//     `use_future`. One that does converts a #289 report into an unrelated
//     "cancellation must not throw arbitrary exceptions"-style misattribution, blaming
//     the code under test -- the shape `tests/tls/test_load_credentials_cancellation.cpp`
//     already paid for. Check it, do not assume it:
//         git grep -n 'catch *(\.\.\.)' -- <the file holding the co_await>
// It holds today at all 11 sites (none of the three `tests/sync` files contains a `try`
// at all, and neither of the two `GTEST_FLAG_SET(throw_on_failure, ...)` setters links
// into their binaries) -- but that is a measurement, and the condition is the thing.
//
// ⚠️ `site` IS REQUIRED, deliberately more than the sibling primitives require, so that
// an UNLABELLED call cannot be written by omission -- every site is then seam-forceable
// (`ci/red-arms/batch19-labels.txt`, 11/11 RED).
//
// ⚠️ IT IS NOT A COMPILE-TIME EXCLUSION, and an earlier revision of this comment claimed
// it was. `yield_window_then_ready(fut, 8, 0)` COMPILES: a bare `0` is a null pointer
// constant, binds to `const char*`, and yields a site that `forced_miss_here` can never
// arm. Exactly the hazard the sibling overloads document for themselves, not a case this
// signature removes. What it does remove is the SILENT-null report: the stream below uses
// a visible fallback rather than `operator<<(const char*, nullptr)`, which is UB. Check
// the tree for the shape rather than assuming it cannot occur:
//     git grep -n 'yield_window_then_ready(' -- tests/ | grep -E ', *0 *[,)]'

//
// A free function rather than an RAII guard like `quiesce_on_exit`, for THREE
// reasons — the first is the obvious one and the other two are the load-bearing
// ones:
//   1. `quiesce_on_exit` requires a non-null `fixpp::core::Clock&` (its
//      `clock` member below) and these fixtures assign none.
//   2. It must run ONLY on the miss branch. `quiesce_on_exit` drains
//      unconditionally at scope exit; arming one per call at a site invoked 32
//      times, each measured at ~27 us, would reintroduce exactly the per-call
//      cost this shape exists to avoid.
//   3. At a callee like `Fixture::feed`, the state that must stay alive is the
//      CALLER'S expression-temporary. No guard the callee declares can extend
//      that; only code running before the callee returns can drain it. A guard
//      is the wrong shape there, not merely an unavailable one.
//
// ⚠️ DIVERGENCE FROM `quiesce_on_exit`, AND IT IS A KNOWN TRAP FOR THE REST OF
// #289's MIGRATION: this does NOT close a transport. `quiesce_on_exit` grew its
// `transport` field (below) from a real defect (gate-b/r1 P1-1) — cancelling
// clock sleeps does not unstick a coroutine parked in `async_write` /
// `async_read_some`, which completes only when the transport itself is closed.
// Stated as a CONDITION rather than a count, because the count form of this
// sentence was already going stale. It used to read "no caller here attaches a
// live Transport … so the gap is latent", and #307 lands exactly such a caller
// (`CompID_KnobOff_AuthzAllowListStillEnforced`, which attaches a NullSinkTransport
// and has no Clock). A sentence that names its own falsification condition — "it
// stops being latent for the FIRST fixture that…" — should have been written as
// that condition in the first place. Conditions are merge-order independent;
// counts create an obligation on whoever merges next.
//
// The condition:
//
//     A caller whose transport can PARK a coroutine — i.e. whose async_write /
//     async_read_some can stay pending — MUST use `quiesce_on_exit` with
//     `.transport` set, or `cancel_and_drain_or_report` with its `transport`
//     argument (#322), or close the transport itself before calling this.
//     `drain_or_report` cannot close a transport and never will, whoever calls it.
//
// A transport that cannot park is unaffected: that is a property of the transport,
// not of how many callers exist. #307's is of that kind — its `async_read_some`
// reports EOF immediately and its `async_write` swallows its bytes — so the gap is
// unreachable there. Do not read "unreachable at that caller" as "unreachable".
//
// Call this while EVERY object the suspended coroutine references is still
// alive. That is not automatic: a fixture destructor body protects fixture
// MEMBERS, but a coroutine holding a span into a caller's temporary, or into a
// block-local declared after the fixture, outlives its referent unless the
// drain happens in THAT scope. Both shapes exist at the #289 sites.
//
// `ioc.stopped()` is a DISJUNCTION and is NOT authoritative — see
// `quiesce_on_exit`'s comment on the disjunction, below.
// A false return is evidence of residual work, not proof of its absence.

        // "fixed some sites of a claim, missed another" class keeps recurring.
        //
        // WHAT THIS COSTS A CALLER, bounded rather than left as "it may dispatch",
        // because #289's migration is adding callers faster than anyone re-reads this:
        //   - At the default `kQuiesceBudget` (5 s), and at any budget whose deadline
        //     has NOT already passed at entry, `run_for` enters the scheduler and has
        //     already run every ready handler. The probe can then dispatch at most ONE
        //     handler that became ready exactly at the deadline boundary. On the
        //     quiesced path it dispatches nothing and only sets `stopped_`.
        //   - Only at a zero or already-expired budget does the probe resume work that
        //     `run_for` would not have.
        //
        // ⚠️ THE SECOND BULLET IS A PRECONDITION ON CALLERS, NOT A SURVEY RESULT. It is
        // true today that every non-witness call takes the default budget, but that is a
        // property of the current tree, not an invariant — and #289 is adding callers.
        // A caller passing a zero or already-expired budget makes the probe resume work
        // nothing else would. DO NOT pass one here without reading the paragraph below.
        //
        // ⚠️ AND THE SAFETY OF THAT DISPATCH IS A PROPERTY OF THE CALL SITE, NOT OF THIS
        // FUNCTION. An earlier version of this comment claimed the dispatch "happens in
        // the CALLER'S scope, so anything the resumed frame borrowed is still alive by
        // construction". That is true of a MISS-BRANCH drain — the shape this helper was
        // designed for, where the drain runs inside the scope that still owns the
        // borrowed storage — and FALSE of a DESTRUCTOR-BODY drain, which is the other
        // shape callers actually use. A destructor body protects fixture MEMBERS; a
        // caller's temporary, or a block-local declared after the fixture, is already
        // dead by then.
        //
        // Both shapes exist right now, in one file:
        //   `Fixture::feed`'s own miss-branch drain — SAFE
        //   `~Fixture()`'s drain                    — NOT
        // and that is not a hypothetical pairing: deleting the in-`feed` drain while
        // keeping `~Fixture`'s reproduces a `heap-use-after-free` under ASan, because
        // `~Fixture`'s drain is precisely what RESUMES the frame over the dead temporary.
        //
        // ⚠️ (gate-b/r2) SAFE ABOVE IS CONDITIONAL, not unqualified: it holds only
        // because `feed`'s own drain SUCCEEDS at this call site. If `drain_or_report`
        // ever reported a residual here, `feed` returns anyway (this function is
        // `void`), and `~Fixture`'s LATER drain would then resume a frame whose
        // borrowed temporary is already gone -- `feed` cannot retain it; the storage
        // is not its to hold. It does not bite HERE because this fixture has no
        // clock and no transport (`quiesce_on_exit`'s ⚠️ DIVERGENCE paragraph above
        // applies: no forcing lever, nothing closes a transport, nothing cancels a
        // sleep), so nothing between `feed`'s drain and `~Fixture`'s can change a
        // frame's readiness -- a frame that survives `feed`'s 5 s drain is in the
        // same state at `~Fixture`. The one caller that reaches the miss branch with
        // non-default durations leaves a single posted handler, which the default
        // budget's drain dispatches.
        //
        // The remedy for the day this DOES bite is not a `bool` return from
        // `drain_or_report` -- that pushes a policy decision onto every #289
        // migration call site, and it still would not help `feed`, which cannot
        // retain a caller's temporary regardless of what it is told. The remedy is
        // the arena-copy pattern `logout_exchange_test.cpp`'s `feed_inbound` already
        // uses: copy into a fixture-owned arena declared before `ioc` (so it
        // outlives `ioc`'s own destruction) and span the copy, never the caller's
        // own buffer.
        //
        // So this probe confers no safety. It inherits whatever the call site already
        // guarantees, and it makes a resumption slightly more likely at sites that were
        // quiet only because nothing resumed them. (Correction owed to the #289/#307
        // session, which had the RED oracle for it.)

// `run()` returns when the context has NO WORK LEFT, which is not the same as "the
// coroutine finished". Two ways it returns early:
//
//   (a) the frame is suspended on something this context does not drive -- an op on a
//       different executor, an external promise -- so the work count reaches zero with the
//       frame still parked. `get()` then blocks forever.
//   (b) THE CONTEXT WAS ALREADY STOPPED. `run()` returns IMMEDIATELY, having dispatched
//       nothing, if `restart()` was not called after the previous `run()`. These tests
//       reuse one `io_context` across several `co_spawn`/`run` pairs and hand-write the
//       `restart()` between them; a missing one is a one-line edit away and turns the
//       `get()` below into a permanent wedge with no diagnostic at all.
//
// ⚠️ (a) CANNOT FIRE WHILE THE SPAWN EXECUTOR'S CONTEXT IS THE DRIVEN ONE. That is the
// CONDITION, and it is measured rather than argued here:
//     tests/sync/test_co_spawn_work_guard_contract.cpp
// Arm 1 is (a)'s own case -- a frame parked on an op this context does not drive -- and
// shows the context UNEXHAUSTED. Arm 4 is one token away, the frame spawned on a
// DIFFERENT context, and shows the driven one exhausting at once with the frame live. So
// (a) is what happens when the condition does not hold, and checking it is checking a
// name, not enumerating a coroutine's suspension points.
// ⚠️ THAT LEAVES (b) AS THE LIVE ONE OF THE TWO ABOVE. It is arm 3, and it is the reason
// the success path below still touches no context state: see the `restart()` note further
// down, which this does not change.
// ⚠️ THE LIST OF TWO IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE, and calling it "the two ways" is what let (a)
// stand unchallenged for so long. A third: someone called `ioc.stop()`, after which
// `run()` returns with the frame parked exactly as in (b). A fourth is not about `run()`
// at all -- exhaustion means the FRAME completed, which is not the same as the FUTURE
// being ready when the completion token carries a foreign associated executor (arm 6).
// Both are measured in the same file; neither has a live site under `tests/` today, and
// that last clause is a measurement, not a property.
// ⚠️ WHAT THIS FUNCTION BUYS AGAINST (b), STATED AT THE WIDTH IT ACTUALLY HOLDS: the
// `run()` below is followed by a readiness check ON `fut`, so a run that dispatched
// nothing cannot reach `return true` with `fut` unready -- it yields either an
// already-ready `fut` or a REPORTED miss via `kRunMiss`. Loud either way, for `fut`.
// ⚠️ IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT ANY OTHER FUTURE. A caller that guards `fh` here and then
// `.get()`s a DIFFERENT future needs its own argument, and an earlier draft of this
// paragraph generalised past that -- claiming (b) "is not a wedge at a migrated site",
// unqualified, while the body checks one future. A hostile round found the over-reach.
// The narrow statement is the durable one; anything wider is a claim about callers, which
// belongs in a batch record and not in a header.
//
// ⚠️ THE MISS BRANCH IS ONE FIXED SHAPE HERE, WHICH IS WHY IT IS INSIDE. Every other #289
// recipe spells its miss branch at the site because the branches VARY -- `drain_or_report`
// vs `cancel_and_drain_or_report` vs a site-specific pump, and a value-returning helper
// needs `kWindowMissSentinel`. At an unbounded-`run()` site none of that varies: there is
// no clock to cancel against (these fixtures assign none) and no window to have missed. A
// site that DOES need a different miss branch must call the two halves itself rather than
// widening this one -- see `run_window_then_ready`, which is exactly that.
// ⚠️ The cost of putting `ADD_FAILURE()` in a header is that gtest reports THIS file and
// line rather than the caller's. Accepted deliberately: the report streams `site`, which
// identifies the caller more precisely than a line number does and does not rot when the
// file moves. `drain_or_report` already reports from here for the same reason.
// ⚠️ AND THERE IS NO `try`/`catch` HERE, WHICH IS A CONDITION ON THE CALLER, NOT AN
// OVERSIGHT. `ADD_FAILURE()` THROWS under `--gtest_throw_on_failure`, and `drain_or_report`
// below carries an unconditional no-throw contract because it is reached from destructor
// BODIES, where an escaping throw meets an implicitly-noexcept frame and terminates. This
// helper is safe without one only while BOTH hold at the call site:
//   (a) it sits in a frame that may throw -- a TEST body or a non-`noexcept` function; and
//   (b) NO ENCLOSING `catch (...)` stands between it and the frame that should receive the
//       throw.
// ⚠️ (b) IS NOT A REFINEMENT OF (a); it is a second, independent condition, and the first
// version of this comment had only (a). A site in
// `tests/tls/test_load_credentials_cancellation.cpp` SATISFIED (a) and still failed: the
// guard sat inside `try { … } catch (const std::system_error&) {…} catch (...) { flag = true; }`,
// so under `--gtest_throw_on_failure` the ADD_FAILURE threw, the site's own `catch (...)`
// swallowed it, `return;` never ran, and a #289 miss surfaced as
// "cancellation must not throw arbitrary exceptions" -- blaming the code under test.
// Found by the batch-17 hostile round, with a control at a non-`try` site in the same binary
// under the same flag to make the attribution stick. A caller in a destructor needs the
// guard `drain_or_report` has. Stated as the CONDITIONS rather than as a count of today's
// callers, which would rot the moment one is added.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THIS DOES **NOT** BUY, stated because it is the first thing a reader proposes: it
// does not bound `run()` itself. If the context always has work -- a timer chain, a live
// socket -- `run()` never returns and this guard is never reached. That is a DIFFERENT
// hazard from #289's unconditional `get()`, it is covered by ctest's per-test timeout
// (#337), and converting `run()` to `run_for(kPumpBudget)` here would trade a wedge for a
// false RED on the slowest sanitiser leg. Deliberately not done.
//
// ⚠️ IT TOUCHES NO CONTEXT STATE ON THE SUCCESS PATH -- no `restart()`, unlike
// `run_window_then_ready`. That is why this is a separate primitive rather than a
// `window = infinite` argument: the migrated sites hand-write their own `restart()` calls
// between pairs, so a helper that restarted would silently take over a decision each site
// currently states, at every call site rather than at one. ⚠️ NOT "because a site reads the
// stopped flag" -- that was the first
// draft of this sentence and it is FALSE: every `stopped()` in the migrated files is
// `engine.stopped()`, none is `ioc.stopped()`. The restart is the SITE's statement to make,
// which does not depend on anyone reading the flag back. The miss branch does need a
// restarted context, and `drain_or_report` calls `ioc.restart()` itself before pumping.
//
// ⚠️ THE FORCED PATH RETURNS WITHOUT RUNNING, and what that preserves here is NOT what
// clause (b) of `run_window_then_ready` preserves. There, forcing preserves a SUSPENDED
// frame, because that site's window had work queued and pending before it opened. Here
// nothing has run at all, so forcing preserves an UNSTARTED one: the co_spawn'd coroutine
// has not reached its first suspension point. The drain therefore STARTS the frame rather
// than resuming it. Both exercise the drain against a live frame -- the obligation that
// matters -- but a claim about WHICH suspension point the drain resumes is false at these
// sites, and an earlier draft of this comment made it by copying clause (b) across.

// under `use_awaitable`, which THROWS `std::system_error` on a non-zero code
// (same function's `async_initiate` comment); and `run_liveness_loop`'s `catch (const
// std::system_error&)` sits OUTSIDE its `while (fsm_state_ == fsm_state::Active)` loop
// (src/session/session.cpp), so the throw crosses the loop boundary and converts
// to a clean `co_return`. A single cancel therefore DOES terminate a sleeping
// liveness loop -- it does not merely wake it to sleep again. Worth writing down:
// the loop re-arms on every normal wake, so "cancellation kills it" is a property
// of the THROW escaping the loop, not of the cancellation itself.
//
// WHAT THE ONE-SHOT PAIR MISSES is therefore only this: `sleep_until` re-registers
// freely whenever the deadline is still in the future
// (`mock_clock::sleep_until`'s waiter-registration branch), and `cancel_sleeps()` installs nothing
// to reject a LATER registration. So a miss branch whose drain itself COMPLETES A STATE TRANSITION
// that co_spawns a sleeping coroutine -- `run_liveness_loop`'s `sleep_until` and
// `run_logout_phase1`'s are the two known instances -- arms its sleep AFTER the single cancel has
// already run. Nothing then releases it, and the pair burns the whole budget before reporting a
// residual the caller has no lever to clear. Alternating the cancel with the drain closes exactly
// that window.
//
// THREE BUCKETS, NOT TWO, and the discriminator is WHERE the miss falls -- whether
// the drain performs the transition, not merely whether the fixture has a clock.
// Measured on test_validate_gate_logon_arm.cpp with `window = grace = 0ms`:
// `Row_F_InboundLogout_NoRejectLoop/logon-ack` (the drain performs the Active
// transition) took 5000 ms and reported two failures; the pre-Active control
// `Row_F_InboundReject_NoRejectLoop/open` took 0 ms and reported one.
//
// ⚠️ (#322) THE PER-SLICE CANCEL IS SAFE FOR A REAL CLOCK TOO, AND THAT IS NOT
// OBVIOUS FROM THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE, which reasons entirely about `mock_clock`.
// The delegation brought `system_clock_source` sites under this loop for the
// first time (`test_live_outbound_serialized.cpp` binds one at all seven of
// its guard sites -- five built purely for the guard, two shared with the
// session's own clock), and that implementation does something `mock_clock`
// does not: `cancel_sleeps()` does not complete waiters inline, it walks an
// in-flight map and `asio::post`s a `sp->cancel()` onto each live timer's own
// executor (src/core/system_clock_source.cpp, `cancel_sleeps`). Posting new work
// on EVERY slice is exactly the shape that could keep a context from ever
// draining.
//
// It terminates, for reasons read from the source rather than inferred from a
// green suite, and the strongest one is structural, though it covers only five
// of the seven sites. At those five (TestRequestReplyWriteErrorDisconnectsSession,
// CloseCancelsBlockedPublicSend, GracefulCloseCancelsBlockedPublicSend,
// CallerCancelledMidCloseDoesNotWedgeSecondClose, BudgetMissQuiescesBeforeSessionTeardown)
// `teardown_clock` is a freshly-constructed source that nothing but the guard
// holds, and the guard only ever calls `cancel_sleeps()` on it — so nothing can
// register a sleep there and `inflight` is empty BY CONSTRUCTION, and the
// per-slice cancel is INERT at those five sites, with nothing for it to do. The
// other two (LivenessHeartbeatWriteErrorStopsLoop, CloseBeforeLivenessStartsDoesNotLeaveQueuedUaf)
// share their clock with the session (`eng.clock = clock`), so the lever is live there, and it
// rests on two mechanisms that hold in the general case: the map holds `weak_ptr`, and only entries
// that still lock get a post; and `sleep_until` installs an RAII `dereg` guard that erases its
// entry on scope exit, covering the deadline-reached, cancelled and exception paths alike. So even
// a shared clock's cancelled sleep de-registers as its frame unwinds and later slices post nothing.
//
// Cost, measured at -O0 with ASan (the preset that actually runs this): on an
// empty container both clock types are indistinguishable from a loop with no
// cancel at all — under ~2 us against an 18-24 us slice, below the noise floor.
// The pathological never-erased case is bounded and linear, ~+18 us per slice per
// live entry, not runaway.
//
// ⚠️ DIAGNOSTIC QUALITY ON AN ALREADY-FAILING PATH, not a lifetime fix. Both arms
// above are ASan-clean. This does not make a missed window safe and must not be
// described as doing so; it stops the report from misdescribing why the context
// would not quiesce.
//
// ⚠️ IT CLOSES A TRANSPORT ONLY IF YOU PASS ONE, and that is a CONDITION on the
// call, not a property of the helper. `transport` defaults to nullptr, and at a
// null transport this drain is exactly what it was before #322: two clock levers
// and nothing that can complete a parked async_write/async_read_some.
// `drain_or_report`'s ⚠️ DIVERGENCE paragraph above states the binding condition and
// it applies here in that form: a caller whose transport can PARK a coroutine --
// i.e. whose async_write / async_read_some can stay pending -- MUST pass it as
// `transport` here (or set `quiesce_on_exit::transport`, which is the same lever
// reached through the guard), or close the transport itself before calling this.
//
// The pointee must OUTLIVE the call: `close()` is invoked unconditionally when the
// pointer is non-null. `Transport::close()` is assumed noexcept and idempotent
// (true of every transport in this suite), so passing an already-closed transport
// is safe. It is closed ONCE, before the first slice, and INSIDE
// `pump_or_report_throw` -- see the body for why that placement is load-bearing
// rather than incidental.
//
// Every caveat `drain_or_report` carries about WHEN to call a drain binds here too:
// call this while every object the suspended coroutine references is still alive,
// and note that `ioc.stopped()` is a DISJUNCTION rather than an exact detector (see
// `quiesce_on_exit`'s comment on the disjunction, below).
//
// Reports AT MOST ONCE, at the end. A per-slice report would emit thousands of
// failures on precisely the path that is already failing.

// Reordering the declarations instead cannot work, for TWO independent reasons.
// An earlier revision of this comment gave only the second one and presented it
// as the reason; that was incomplete, and the first is the load-bearing one
// because it is unconditional rather than schedule-dependent:
//
//  1. NOTHING HOLDING A STRAND TAKEN FROM THE CONTEXT MAY OUTLIVE THE CONTEXT.
//     `asio::strand`'s handle is a shared_ptr<strand_impl>, and
//     `strand_impl::~strand_impl()` locks `service_->mutex_` and unlinks itself
//     from `service_->impl_list_` (asio/detail/impl/strand_executor_service.ipp
//     :83-94), where `service_` is a RAW pointer to a service owned by the
//     io_context's registry. `~execution_context()` runs `shutdown()` then
//     `destroy()`, and `destroy()` destroys every service
//     (asio/impl/execution_context.ipp:60-64); `shutdown()` sets
//     `impl->shutdown_` but never detaches `service_`
//     (strand_executor_service.ipp:34-50). So destroying the context first and
//     the strand after is a heap-use-after-free EVERY TIME, not on a race.
//     This reaches further than it looks: under the default
//     `threading_mode::per_session_strand` a Session's bound executor IS such a
//     strand (`SessionConfig::mode`'s `per_session_strand` default; `session_executor`'s private
//     state), and so is `Engine::control_strand_` (its member declaration in engine.hpp). A BARE
//     `io_context::executor_type` is NOT affected — it is untracked and its
//     destructor touches nothing — so an `executor_override` may outlive the
//     context safely. Measured both arms under ASan; only the strand faults.
//  2. The clock's parked waiters hold work guards on the io_context, so on that
//     path either destruction order has a dangling side.
//
// The only safe state is no pending state, and this guard's job is to reach it
// where it can and to REPORT where it cannot. It carries two forcing levers —
// `transport` below, and the repeated `cancel_sleeps()` it inherits by delegating
// — neither of which makes a residual impossible.
//
// ⚠️ (#322) THIS USED TO SAY `run_for` WAS CHOSEN OVER A `run_one_for` LOOP
// DELIBERATELY, AND THE ARGUMENT NO LONGER HOLDS. It read: a slice-at-a-time drain
// can return on "nothing was ready within the slice" and leave work queued,
// because `run_one_until` tests its deadline before dispatching. That objection is
// sound against the OBVIOUS sliced loop and does not bind
// `cancel_and_drain_or_report`'s, which never breaks on an empty slice: it breaks
// only on `ioc.stopped()` AFTER `poll_one()` has consulted the work count, or on
// the deadline. The paragraph predated that loop; it was never a considered
// rejection of this shape. Kept as a correction rather than deleted, because a
// reader who remembers the old rationale needs to see it retired.
//
// What survives from it is the LIMIT, which is unchanged by the delegation: a
// co_spawn frame holds a tracked-work guard, so a coroutine parked on anything
// neither lever reaches keeps the context non-empty for the full budget, and the
// drain returns with that frame still pending — sufficient for the case this guard
// exists for, not a general fix.
//
// WHAT THE SLICING COSTS, measured rather than argued, because a per-slice loop
// at every plain `quiesce_on_exit` teardown site (population and re-derivation
// recipe: the "THE POPULATION" paragraph in
// `test_test_request_id_cross_session_race.cpp`, and its
// `grep -rn 'quiesce_on_exit [a-zA-Z_]*{' tests/` recipe) is exactly the
// shape that quietly gets expensive.
// Instrumented by breaking on the loop's own `restart()`, so the slice count is
// exact rather than a proxy:
//
//   session_logout_exchange (12 sites, mock_clock)        12 drains / 12 slices
//   LiveOutboundSerializedTest (7 sites: 5 inert / 2 live)  7 drains /  7 slices
//
// One slice per drain, at every site measured so far: the loop body cannot run
// zero times, so 19 drains totalling 19 slices means every drain currently in
// the suites quiesces inside a single `kPumpSlice`. That is a CONDITION, not a
// property of the loop -- a site whose work takes longer than `kPumpSlice` to
// quiesce takes roughly proportionally more slices, not an exact ⌈work / kPumpSlice⌉:
// per-slice overhead (measured above at ~18-24 us per pass)
// and the trailing `poll_one()` both affect which slice actually completes the
// work, so the count is an approximation, not arithmetic.
//
// And even at ONE slice this is NOT the same op sequence the old single-`run_for`
// destructor did: `cancel_sleeps()`, `ioc.restart()` and `poll_one()` were each
// ALREADY performed once by the old destructor -- they are not new at one slice,
// only REPEATED by every additional one. What one slice genuinely adds over the
// old destructor is two `steady_clock::now()`, a `std::min`, and a `stopped()` +
// deadline comparison -- plus `run_for(5s)` becoming `run_for(<=1ms)`.
//
// This is a DATED, SCOPED MEASUREMENT, not a property of the loop: the 19/19
// count above and the 83-slice figure below came from a manual debugger session
// (a breakpoint on the loop's own `restart()`), not a checked-in instrument, and
// both describe the CURRENT suites only. A future site whose quiescing spans
// several slices would still be correct, merely slower, and would not
// contradict this paragraph. The witness suites, which DO burn budget, counted
// 83 slices across 9 drains at that same session.
//
// The cost that does exist is confined to the already-failing path, and it is
// CPU, not wall: at a 5 s budget both loop shapes are budget-bound at 5000 ms
// wall, and the sliced one spends ~89 ms CPU idle / ~136 ms against a re-arming
// sleeper, versus <1 ms for the single `run_for`. A test on that path is already
// reporting `kDrainResidual`.
//
// `io_context::stopped()` is a DISJUNCTION, not an exact detector: it is true
// either because the context ran out of work or because something called
// `stop()` explicitly (asio `io_context.hpp:453-455`). The `stop()` sweep
// supports the false-negative direction only: for any `io_context` reachable
// from this caller, the preceding `restart()` clears any prior stopped flag and
// nothing on this call path calls `stop()` on that same context. The one
// `tests/support/` exception is `disjoint_session_executor`'s `~disjoint_session_executor()`'s
// `ioc_.stop()`, but that helper owns a private `ioc_` and is included only by
// `tests/core/test_trace_context_resume.cpp`, so it is out of reach here. The
// false-positive sweep is separate: for any `io_context` reachable from this
// caller, no production code outside `src/capi/` creates a work guard, so
// `stopped()==false` here really does mean session/coroutine work is still
// outstanding.
//
// ⚠️ (#305) THAT LAST SENTENCE WAS AN OVER-CLAIM, AND THE PROBE IS WHAT MAKES IT
// TRUE. (#322) The probe is ABOVE now, in `cancel_and_drain_or_report`; this
// headline still said "below" after the body was repointed, which is the
// fixed-one-of-two-identical-shapes class this very paragraph memorialises.
//
// The work-guard census above is sound as far as it goes, but it
// reasons only about who can hold work OPEN — it never asks whether the work
// count was CONSULTED. `run_for` can return without consulting it at all (see the
// probe in `cancel_and_drain_or_report`), and then `stopped()==false` means "the
// deadline had already passed", not "work is outstanding". The census could not
// have caught that, because the defect is not in the population it enumerates.
// Kept, rather than deleted and quietly rewritten, so the shape of the mistake
// stays visible: an exhaustive sweep of the wrong axis reads exactly like proof.
//
// ⚠️ (#322) THE SLEEP ARMED DURING THE GUARD'S OWN DRAIN IS NOW FORCED, NOT MERELY
// OBSERVED. This paragraph used to end "this guard cannot force that residual,
// only observe it", and that stopped being true when #321 landed
// `cancel_and_drain_or_report`. The mechanism it described is real and unchanged:
// `mock_clock::sleep_until` registers a new waiter whenever the deadline is still
// in the future (`mock_clock::sleep_until`'s waiter-registration branch), and a SINGLE
// `cancel_sleeps()` installs nothing to reject a later registration
// (`mock_clock::cancel_sleeps()` itself), so a coroutine whose first run happens
// during the drain — the session liveness loop's `sleep_until`,
// `Session::run_liveness_loop`, is the concrete case — arms a sleep the one-shot
// cancel has already missed. What changed is the lever: this destructor delegates
// to `cancel_and_drain_or_report`, whose loop alternates the cancel with the
// drain, so the sleep armed by slice N is released by slice N+1. Pinned by
// CancelAndDrainOrReportWitness.{OneShotCancelThenDrainCannotReleaseTheSleep,
// ReleasesASleepArmedDuringItsOwnDrain}.
//
// It remains an OBSERVER for every residual neither lever reaches — a coroutine
// parked on something that is not a clock sleep and not this transport. Report
// what was observed rather than exit silently: ADD_FAILURE (non-fatal — a fatal
// assertion in a destructor is an inert `return`) so a guard that never quiesces
// shows up in CI instead of leaving a dangling frame to fire nondeterministically
// later. The report is emitted by the primitive and carries the site
// `"quiesce_on_exit"`, which is what discriminates it from a direct call.

    // aggregate initialisation's current 5s behaviour. A caller with a
    // deterministic reason to bound this tighter (e.g. a test whose only purpose
    // is to trigger the residual report) may supply a shorter budget. (#322) That
    // report is no longer "the branch below" -- it is `cancel_and_drain_or_report`'s
    // `ADD_FAILURE`, which this guard reaches by delegating.
    std::chrono::steady_clock::duration budget = kQuiesceBudget;

    // Cancelling clock sleeps is not sufficient to unstick a coroutine parked
    // in async_write/async_read_some on a still-open transport — that op
    // completes only when the transport itself is closed. nullptr (default)
    // when no such transport is in play; set it (this struct is a plain
    // aggregate, so the field may be assigned after construction, e.g. once
    // the caller attaches the transport) whenever one is — which is how every
    // real caller does it, so a two-argument `{ioc, clock}` aggregate init is
    // NOT evidence the lever is unset.
    //
    // (#322) THE CONTRACT IS THE PRIMITIVE'S, NOT THIS FIELD'S. Since the
    // destructor delegates, this is a forwarding slot: it is passed straight to
    // `cancel_and_drain_or_report`'s `transport` argument, which is what
    // dereferences it and where the `close()` happens. Requirements on the
    // pointee — it must outlive the call, `close()` is assumed noexcept and
    // idempotent, it is closed once before the first slice — are stated there
    // (see its ⚠️ IT CLOSES A TRANSPORT ONLY IF YOU PASS ONE paragraph) and are
    // deliberately NOT restated here; an earlier copy of them at this field had
    // already drifted into naming the wrong dereferencing frame.
    //
    // What is local to the guard, and only this: the pointee must be declared
    // BEFORE the guard, since the guard's own destruction is what triggers the
    // forwarding. Whether it is a `Session`-owned transport or a plain
    // block-local does not matter, and both shapes exist. Declaring the guard
    // first leaves this dangling.

    // (#322) ONE DELEGATING CALL, and every part of the teardown this destructor
    // used to spell out now lives in `cancel_and_drain_or_report`: the #308
    // try/catch and `pump_or_report_throw` wrapping, the #305 probe, the residual
    // `ADD_FAILURE`, and the transport close INSIDE the pump.
    //
    // ⚠️ IT MUST STAY ONE CALL. "Close the transport, then call the primitive"
    // would put `transport->close()` back in THIS frame -- and that changes
    // nothing today either way: `close()` and `cancel_sleeps()` are *declared*
    // `virtual ... noexcept = 0`: an override declared with a LOOSER exception
    // specification is ill-formed, so every override is itself `noexcept`. That is
    // a signature-time guarantee, not a runtime one -- `noexcept` is a property of
    // the CALLEE, so an override whose BODY throws is still well-formed, and calls
    // `std::terminate` at THAT function's own boundary whether it is called
    // from here or from inside the primitive's lambda (see the primitive's own
    // ⚠️ THE CLOSE IS INSIDE THE GUARD paragraph). It stays inside the
    // primitive anyway, per #308's refusal and #322's requirement: containment
    // is already correct if either interface is ever relaxed to
    // potentially-throwing, and the primitive taking the transport is what
    // lets the refusal survive the delegation.
    //
    // Nothing may escape here either, and nothing does: every path through
    // `cancel_and_drain_or_report` is inside its own unconditional `catch (...)`
    // (its own comment: the exception policy for every drain in this header is
    // decided ONCE), including the throwing `ADD_FAILURE()` that
    // `--gtest_throw_on_failure` produces. So this destructor adds no handler of
    // its own -- a second one would be the duplicated try/catch
    // `pump_or_report_throw`'s comment argues against.
