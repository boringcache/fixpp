// Seam #6 — Logout exchange (005-session-establishment-fsm T043 / Phase 6 / US4).
//
// Scenarios covered (FR-005 / SC-005 / [FIX-SL §4.6]):
//
//  1. GracefulBothDirections: Active → initiate Logout → outbound Logout emitted
//     (transport_send called, 35=5) → inbound Logout received → FSM → Disconnected.
//
//  2. NeverConfirmedForceDisconnect: Active → initiate Logout → clock-bound 2 s
//     timeout → FSM → Disconnected (session_logout_timeout, slot 73).
//
//  3-7. Non-Active Logout transitions (data-model.md matrix cells):
//       3. NotConnected + inbound Logout → Disconnected ([FIX-SL §4.6]).
//       4. LogonSent    + inbound Logout → Disconnected ([FIX-SL §4.6]).
//       5. LogonReceived + inbound Logout → Disconnected.
//       6. Active + inbound Logout       → emit Logout, → Disconnected (confirm).
//       7. LogoutSent + inbound Logout   → Disconnected (confirm, idempotent).
//       8. Disconnected + inbound Logout → ignored (session_already_closed).
//
//  9. InitiateLogoutFromActive: close(graceful) while Active emits a Logout
//     frame then moves FSM → LogoutSent before the peer confirms.
//
// (T029 outbound-half I-3 ordering — store(outbound) BEFORE transport_send —
//  is asserted by seam #10 in durable_before_transmit_test.cpp, where a
//  RecordingStoreFactory injects an OrderingStore that records "store_out"
//  into a shared vector that the transport_send callback later appends
//  "transport_send" to; the test asserts the literal ["store_out", "transport_send"]
//  ordering. That is the natural home for the I-3 outbound assertion; not
//  duplicated here.)

// ── #433: WHICH SIDE STALLED? ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `SessionGracefulCloseFlushesFileStore` drives a session on a single-threaded
// `io_context` while its FileStore offloads onto a real `asio::thread_pool`. A
// bounded pump that exhausts its budget there reports only that the awaited
// future never became ready -- never WHERE the time went. #433 can offer a
// suspect and not a cause: nothing measured what the pool was doing.
//
// `install_store_offload_probe` (include/fixpp/session/file_store.hpp, under
// FIXPP_TEST_HOOKS) fires at the start of an offloaded lambda, on the pool
// thread, before its first syscall. `install_store_offload_exit_probe` fires
// when that callable has returned or thrown, from the single `offload_to`
// funnel in src/session/file_store.cpp. Together they bracket the BLOCKING
// CALLABLE on the pool side.
//
// ⚠️ THE PAIR IS NOT #433'S SUBMIT/COMPLETE PAIR, AND MUST NOT BE RECORDED AS
// ONE. #433 asks for submit → completion-posted-back, which spans the
// io_context side; neither seam observes that side. What the pair adds over
// entry alone is one genuinely new fact -- whether an offloaded callable is
// still running RIGHT NOW -- and nothing about the io_context.
//
// ⚠️ AN ABSOLUTE ENTRY COUNT IS NOT EVIDENCE ABOUT THE AWAITED OPERATION: more
// than one offload can precede the one a labelled pump is waiting on, so
// `N >= 1` is consistent with "an earlier, unrelated offload entered and
// returned, and the one being awaited was never submitted". Re-derive which
// paths can offload before trusting a count:
//   git grep -n 'g_store_offload_probe' src/session/file_store.cpp
// Snapshot the counter immediately BEFORE the labelled pump and report the
// DELTA since that snapshot, never the absolute count:
//
//   delta >= 1   an offload reached a pool thread since the snapshot and the
//                awaited operation still has not completed.
//
// The second reported number is the IN-FLIGHT GAUGE, not an exit delta:
//
//   in flight k  exactly k offloaded callables are between their entry and
//                their return AT THE INSTANT THE REPORT IS BUILT. k > 0 means
//                something is sitting inside an offloaded callable -- which is
//                what the slow-syscall hypothesis predicts. k == 0 means
//                nothing is.
//
// ⚠️ DO NOT REPLACE THE GAUGE WITH A COMPARISON OF THE TWO DELTAS. That was
// tried and it was WRONG: the deltas are unmatched, so an offload entering
// before the snapshot and exiting after it inflates the exit delta with no
// entry delta to pair against. See the gauge's own comment for the worked
// counterexample.
//
// ⚠️ NEITHER NUMBER IS ABOUT THE AWAITED OPERATION -- the attribution warning
// above applies to both unchanged, because neither seam carries an operation
// identity. `k == 0` is consistent BOTH with "the awaited operation's callable
// finished and its completion never reached the io_context" AND with "the
// awaited operation was never submitted, and what was counted is unrelated".
// Nothing here tells those apart; it is the io_context side that is
// unobserved, and closing that is what #433 still wants.
//   delta == 0   nothing reached a pool thread since the snapshot. That is the
//                whole of what is measured. ⚠️ THIS LINE USED TO CONTINUE
//                "either the operation was never submitted, or the pool never
//                scheduled it" -- a flat either/or, and it was NOT exhaustive:
//                the awaited operation's own offload may have entered BEFORE
//                the snapshot, and a path may not offload at all. Do not
//                restore a closed list here; if you need one, derive it from
//                the call sites, which move.
//                `probe_file_pool` below posts an unrelated trivial task and
//                reports whether a thread was free for it. It observes nothing
//                about the awaited operation and must not be read as if it did
//                -- only meaningful once delta == 0.
//
// ⚠️ THE PROMISE IS SHARED, NOT CAPTURED BY REFERENCE. On the DID-NOT-RUN
// branch the task is still queued when `probe_file_pool` returns, so a
// reference to a frame local would dangle until `file_pool` is destroyed.
// ⚠️ WHETHER `probe_file_pool`'s negative verdict MEANS "SLOW" OR "WEDGED" IS
// A PROPERTY OF THE OFFLOAD PATH, AND YOU MUST RE-DERIVE IT RATHER THAN READ
// IT HERE. `offload_to` (src/session/file_store.cpp) invokes its callable as
// a PLAIN CALL. A non-coroutine callable therefore cannot `co_await`, cannot
// initiate a second offload, and occupies one pool thread per logical
// operation -- so while that holds of every call site, nested-offload
// deadlock is impossible and a negative verdict points at a slow syscall. A
// call site passing a callable that returns `awaitable<...>` voids the
// argument and puts deadlock back on the table. Check, do not assume:
//   git grep -n 'offload_to(' src/session/file_store.cpp   # then each callable's return type

// all of them except `SessionGracefulCloseFlushesFileStore.FlushRunsAndFramesDurableAfterClose`
// (that one hands `on_inbound_frame` a body-local buffer directly and is safe by
// a different invariant — see its own doc comment) — declare their inbound frame
// AFTER the guard: the arrangement `drain_or_report`'s two-shape taxonomy in
// `pump_until_ready.hpp` (MISS-BRANCH drain vs DESTRUCTOR-BODY drain) calls
// unsafe (a block-local declared after the guard dies BEFORE it, since
// destruction runs in reverse declaration order). They are safe
// only because `feed_inbound` (above) copies each frame into `inbound_frames`, a
// fixture-owned deque, and the coroutine spawned by `feed_inbound_spawn` reads
// THAT span for its whole lifetime — never the caller's own buffer. That
// invariant lives only in prose; nothing pins it. Someone "removing a redundant
// copy" from `feed_inbound_spawn` would leave this whole suite green today and
// flip every one of those sites from safe to hazardous silently. (`inbound_frames`
// is also declared before `ioc` — see its own doc comment — but that is a
// separate, currently-defensive-only invariant, not what makes these sites safe.)
// Re-derive the exact site list on demand (one spelling; resolve hits by hand):
// `grep -n 'quiesce_on_exit [a-zA-Z_]*{' tests/session/logout_exchange_test.cpp`.
//
// A round-1 version of this witness compared `data()` pointers after the
// pump completed, which proves an arena copy EXISTS but not that the
// coroutine actually reads it: `inbound_frames.emplace_back` alone makes
// pointer identity differ from the caller's buffer regardless of which span
// is handed to `co_spawn`, so `stable(inbound_frames.back()) -> stable(frame)`
// -- the exact regression this test exists to catch -- passed unchanged.
//
// This version instead defers the pump: spawn against the arena span, let
// the caller's `std::vector<std::byte>` die at the end of the nested block,
// THEN pump. If the coroutine ever spans the caller's buffer instead of the
// arena copy, resuming it after the buffer is freed is a heap-use-after-free
// that ASan reports directly -- the fault IS the pin, not a downstream
// assertion that could itself be satisfied by an unrelated code path.

// invokes the A1 typed-thunk flush_for_session_close() (session.cpp's
// `close_flush_hook_a1_` dispatch under `mode == close_mode::graceful`)
// and co_awaits it to durable completion (C1 — never detached).
//
// Strategy (discriminating):
//   - FileStore under commit_batched(batch_size=10); session drives 2 frames
//     (outbound Logon + inbound Logon-ack). Total 2 < batch_size=10 → no
//     auto-flush → frames remain in kernel page-cache, not fdatasync'd.
//   - close(close_mode::graceful) is co_awaited; the A1 dispatch calls
//     flush_for_session_close() which runs an offloaded fdatasync (Test 7
//     complement confirms this; here we confirm no UAF + frames durable).
//   - After close completes: open a new FileStore on the same path + assert
//     next_seqnum(outbound,false) > 1 (at least 1 frame was committed,
//     proving fdatasync ran and the counter record is durable).
//   - Pool joined AFTER close() (correct C5a ordering). No ASan/TSan report
//     = no use-of-joined-pool, no UAF.

// through the real `FileStore` offload seam (the production `g_store_offload_probe`
// hook, the same entry-counting mechanism the two labelled pumps above read from),
// so it exercises the real production data path that feeds `describe_offload_progress`.
// It calls `describe_offload_progress` directly rather than reproducing the literal
// `ASSERT_TRUE(pump_until_ready(...)) << ...` streaming expression at kSiteOpen/
// kSiteLogonAck above -- that expression itself is NOT exercised by this arm. Say
// so rather than claim more: this is the shared report BUILDER bound at the real
// production seam, not a capture of the two call sites' own source text.
//
// F6.2 (gate-b/r2, C4): the complementary delta == 0 branch IS witnessed at
// builder scope -- OffloadProbe_ZeroDelta_ReportsFilePoolProbe below (F6.1)
// calls `describe_offload_progress` directly with no offload produced, the
// same scope this arm already occupies for the delta >= 1 branch. It is NOT
// witnessed at the real kSiteOpen/kSiteLogonAck sites, and that narrower
// claim is the one with a real obstacle: `forced_miss_here`'s env var is read
// via a function-local static on its FIRST call in the process
// (tests/support/pump_until_ready.hpp), so a `setenv()` inside a running test
// has no effect once any earlier test has already pumped. Reaching delta == 0
// at the real kSiteOpen/kSiteLogonAck sites requires the env var set BEFORE
// process start, i.e. a separate process invocation:
//   FIXPP_FORCE_WINDOW_MISS='FlushRunsAndFramesDurableAfterClose/open' \
//     ./session_logout_exchange \
//     --gtest_filter='SessionGracefulCloseFlushesFileStore.FlushRunsAndFramesDurableAfterClose'
// `forced_miss_here` (called before `pump_until` ever reaches `ioc.run_for`) returns
// on that FIRST call, so no offload can have entered a pool thread by the time the
// snapshot is compared -- the delta==0 branch, and the probe_file_pool secondary
// path inside it, is what the miss then reaches. Re-run that recipe to re-verify;
// do not trust a cached account of its output.
