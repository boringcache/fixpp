#
# Validates tests/interop/cell_results.yaml against the parent gate-evaluator's
# result schema (contracts/parent-harness-gate-contract.md). This is the in-repo
# half of the per-cell completeness contract: it proves the committed manifest is
# well-formed and that no matrix/corpus cell is silently absent, so the parent
# `interop-gate-evaluator` consumes a schema-conformant input.
#
# 089-quickfix-interop-conversation T026: also validates the STRUCTURE of the
# sibling witness_evidence.yaml artifact (data-model.md §6/§10/§11) — the full
# E-1c/W-3* completeness gates are implemented by later tasks (T066-T092);
# this file proves the three sections exist and are distinguishable from a
# missing/null section, and (T066-T068) implements the E-7a/E-7b/E-7c CHECK
# LOGIC itself, each proven against the CONSTRUCTED fixtures
# contracts/witness-evidence.md § Proof obligations prescribes for it.
# `test_schema_check_opens_no_artifact_path()` below runs the shape/
# `["cells"]`-signature checks against ONE config's per-run emission; the

# accumulated COMMITTED witness_evidence.yaml/cell_results.yaml pair.

# 089 T095a — THE COMMITTED-ARTIFACT GATES
#
# E-1a, E-4, E-1c/W-3b/W-3c, W-3a and E-7a/E-7b/E-7c were each proven only
# against a CONSTRUCTED fixture (`_e7_fixture_complete()` and friends). A gate
# that never reads the committed artifact is not a gate — it cannot fail on
# anything a real sweep produces. T095's matrix populated both artifacts (32
# conformance runs + 8 control runs across 4 configs; 400 witness rows; 20
# validation pairs), so these now range over the REAL files, unconditionally.
#
# ⚠️ The parameter is `committed_cells`, NOT `cells`, and that is deliberate.
# `_discover_cell_checks()` selects every module-level `test_*` whose
# parameters are exactly ["cells"], and `emit_matrix.validate()` runs that set
# against ONE configuration's emission. A 32-slot gate with that signature
# would therefore redden every partial sweep (8 of 32 rows present after the
# first config). The split is the point: `validate()` checks a per-config
# emission, these check the accumulated committed artifact.
#
# Each gate is paired with a forced-miss arm that removes exactly ONE row from
# a deep copy of the real artifact and asserts the gate's OWN diagnostic —
# never a bare "it raised" (rule 2 of quickstart.md § Step 4).

    ⭐ This guards a trap the repo has now hit FIVE times, and every previous
    time the fix was reactive: a `.gitattributes` stanza added after a Windows
    job went red (`*.golden.hpp`, the Orchestra XML, the enum-golden
    dictionaries + generator, the required-golden CSVs -- read that file, each
    one carries its own post-mortem). 089 made it five: `core.autocrlf=true` on
    the windows-msvc runners CRLF-converted `conversation_script.yaml`, so the
    live SHA-256 became a06a8fc7... where the committed evidence records
    8eada580..., and `_check_script_digest_binding` reported it as *evidence
    attesting a script no longer in the tree*. That diagnostic is correct about
    the bytes and completely misleading about the cause -- which is why a guard
    naming the cause is worth more than the fix alone.

    ⚠️ Two arms, because they fail on different platforms:

    1. **The byte arm is native and authoritative but only bites on Windows.**
       A CR in the checked-out file IS the defect, whatever produced it -- a
       missing `.gitattributes` line, an editor, a bad merge. On Linux it
       passes trivially; that is honest, not vacuous, because Linux cannot
       reproduce the condition.
    2. **The attribute arm bites on EVERY platform**, so someone adding a third
       digest-bound script sees it locally instead of discovering it a CI round
       later on a runner they are not watching. If `git` cannot answer, this
       arm FAILS rather than skipping -- a skip here would be the exact
       fail-toward-clean shape this file exists to prevent.

    The population is `SCRIPT_BY_RUN_KIND`, the same mapping the hasher reads,
    so a script added there is covered automatically. That is not circular: the
    dict decides WHICH files are byte-pinned, and this test checks an
    INDEPENDENT property of them (their on-disk bytes and their git attribute).
