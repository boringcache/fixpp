# Changelog

Notable changes to **fixpp**, newest first.

> **Scope, stated explicitly because this file is new.** Article XX §4 of
> `.specify/constitution.md` has required "an entry in `CHANGELOG.md`" for every
> backwards-incompatible constitutional amendment since v0.1 — but the file was never created,
> so the clause has never been satisfiable. It is created here.
>
> ⚠️ **This is not the first amendment that triggered §4, and an earlier revision of this file
> wrongly said it was.** Constitution **v0.4** (`ef9ca2bd`, 2026-07-11) added Article VII §8,
> whose text reads "`gtest_discover_tests` **prohibited** for these buckets" — a banned-pattern
> addition, which §4 classifies as backwards-incompatible. Its own Sync Impact Report
> nonetheless recorded "no banned-pattern addition" and bumped MINOR. That entry is **not
> backfilled here**, because reclassifying a ratified amendment is a separate constitutional act
> requiring its own review. The disposition — backfill v0.4 as v-major, or amend §4 to define
> "banned-pattern addition" narrowly enough to exclude Article VII §8 — is a **named follow-up**.
> Recording the discrepancy is not the same as resolving it, and this note does not resolve it.
>
> This file records **backwards-incompatible constitutional amendments** (Article XX §4) and,
> going forward, **released library versions**. It is not a commit log: routine features, fixes
> and MINOR/PATCH constitution bumps live in git history and in the Sync Impact Reports at the
> top of `.specify/constitution.md`.
>
> ⚠️ The constitution's version and the library's release version are **separate sequences**.
> Constitution v1.0 asserts nothing about project GA.

## Constitution v3.0 — 2026-09-23

**Backwards-incompatible.** Article XX §4 major bump. v2.0's `/speckit-implement` step 5a let the
orchestrator implement task bodies itself on an escalation or for a one-task phase; v3.0 removes both
exceptions, so a PR that used one conformed under v2.0 and does not under v3.0. This is the
constitution's version: it is not a C-ABI or library version.

Ratified 2026-09-23 (PR #500), after Codex Gate A converged at round 4 (0 P1; its one P2, in the
parent edit guard, fixed as prescribed) and the owner signed off.

### Changed

- **Article XVI §6** — the orchestrator does not implement. The clause defines *implement* (production
  code, tests, scripts, build/CI/configuration files, committed generated files and their regeneration,
  and merge-conflict resolution in them, classified by file type) and lists what the orchestrator may
  do, including governance texts and transient build, test and index outputs. The implementer's model is
  configuration, not a constitutional term.
- **Article XVI §7** — the implementer sub-agent applies accepted `/simplify` findings.
- **Article XVII §4** — a user's `/gate-a` or `/gate-b` authorizes that gate's Codex calls; the
  §XVI.8 Codex fallback needs the user's confirmation.
- **Article XVII §5** — accepted findings are applied by the actor the procedure assigns (implementer,
  Gate A rewrite agent, or Codex), never the orchestrator.
- **Article XX §5** — the example hand-off rule names the implementer, not a model.

## Constitution v2.0 — 2026-09-15

**Backwards-incompatible.** Article XX §4 major bump. Both changes loosen a rule, and both attach
obligations that a PR mergeable under v1.0 would now fail, which is the reading v1.0 established.
This is the constitution's version: it is not C-ABI 2.0 and not a library release.

Ratified 2026-09-15 (PR #451), after Codex Gate A converged at round 4 (0 P1 / 0 P2, one P3 fixed)
and the user signed off.

### Added

- **Article X §7 — breaking C-ABI changes before the first public release.** Until the first GitHub
  Release, a breaking C-ABI change bumps MINOR, is marked **BREAKING**, and updates every
  in-repository consumer in the same PR. At that release one PR resets the C-ABI version to `1.0.0`
  and rebases every error code to `introducing_minor` 0; after it, a break requires MAJOR.

### Changed

- **Article IX §5** — the ABI check, and its MAJOR rule, start at the first public release.
- **Article XX §3** — from v2.0 on, every amendment is recorded in its Sync Impact Report with the
  contents the clause lists. This replaces a pointer to a `_log.md` decision log that never existed.
  Earlier reports stay as written.

## Constitution v1.0 — 2026-08-21

**Backwards-incompatible.** Article XX §4 major bump: an effective perf-budget tightening.

Ratified 2026-08-21, after Gate A converged at round 5 (PASS, 0 P1 / 0 P2 / 0 P3) following four
BLOCKs. This heading carried `Unreleased` until both the gate and the sign-off had happened — a
CHANGELOG entry dated as released while the document it describes is still pending is the
lifecycle contradiction Gate A round 3 raised, and it is dated here only because that is no
longer the case.

### Changed

- **Article VIII §2 — the regression budget's comparand.** A **slowdown greater than +5%** —
  the budget is one-sided; a speed-up needs no approval — is now measured against a
  **paired base-vs-candidate run on one runner**, against the merge-base of the candidate and
  the PR's target branch (A-B-A-B, min-per-tree), replacing checked-in `bench/baselines/`
  files. Those files no longer gate the per-PR budget and are reported per row with a named
  reason when not comparable.
- **Article VIII §4 (latency bullet)** — clarified that §2's "checked-in baselines do not gate"
  does **not** reach the v1.0 release baseline, which remains blocking.

### Added

- **Article VIII §2a — fail-closed invariants of the paired comparand.** The base must be the
  merge-base of the candidate and the PR's target branch, distinct from the candidate; a
  crashed, empty or uninformative measurement is a **failure**, as is a missing measurement for
  any paired row **present in the merge-base's `bench/ci-suite.txt`**. Most of these were
  enforced by the implementation but not by the constitution, so a workflow edit could have
  removed them without amending anything.

  **One explicit exception, and only one:** a paired row **absent from the merge-base's
  manifest** is a *candidate-only addition*; that absence is not an error — adding a benched
  binary is what §3 asks for. Such a row stays hard-gated on execution and schema, and is
  excluded from timing comparison for that PR only.

  ⚠️ **The predicate is manifest membership, not buildability**, which over-exempts: a binary
  the merge-base could build but never listed is exempted too (`bench/transport/*` are exactly
  that today — real CMake targets absent from the manifest). Narrowing it needs a semantic
  target census in the base build tree and is a **follow-up**, not claimed here. The clause
  describes the shipped predicate deliberately; a constitution that describes a better
  instrument than the one running is the defect this amendment exists to remove.

  **Paired status is irreversible, with no exception.** A merged `paired` row may not be removed
  or downgraded — there is no approval path and the comparator fails both unconditionally. That
  **includes retiring the benchmark entirely**: to the comparator, deleting a paired row *is*
  removing it. Admitting a retirement path would reopen the resurrection hole the absolute rule
  closes — retire, re-add, collect the addition exemption again — so retiring a paired benchmark
  requires **amending the clause**.

  ⚠️ Named gap: there is consequently **no supported way to delete a paired benchmark**. Doing so
  would need comparator support — an append-only paired-history ledger, and a reintroduced
  identity comparing against its latest paired ancestor rather than qualifying as a fresh
  addition — *and* an amendment, in that order.
- **This file**, per Article XX §4.

### Why this is backwards-incompatible

The amendment both tightens and loosens, and the loosening does not cancel the tightening:

- **Tightening** — five binaries move from having *no hard timing decision at all* to a hard
  **>+50% slowdown** rejection. Changes that were previously mergeable now fail. That is a
  perf-budget tightening under Article XX §4 even though the printed "5%" numeral is unchanged:
  an unenforced obligation became an enforceable rejection criterion.
- **Loosening** — checked-in baselines cease to gate, and 18 of 23 manifest binaries carry no
  automated timing limit.

### Why the comparand changed

`bench/baselines/` could not serve as one. Of **27 tracked files** there, 25 are JSON and 2 are
`.gitkeep`. Of the 25 — an exact partition — **3** carry zero benchmark rows, **10** have no
`cpu_time` key on any row, **1** has a row whose `cpu_time` is `null`, and **11** carry numeric
`cpu_time`. Of those 11, one is a debug build and one more is a hand-authored partial schema,
leaving **nine** usable full-schema release comparands for 23 benched binaries.

Of the five binaries the paired tier gates, **four declare `none:`** in `bench/ci-suite.txt`,
and the fifth's comparand (`dictionary/xml_loader.json`) was shown by issue #263 never to have
described `main` — seeded, invalidated three commits later inside its own PR, never re-seeded,
so the ±5% budget was silently breached 8–16× against it for three months.

**A budget stated against a comparand that does not exist is unenforceable, not strict.**

### Known limits of the replacement, disclosed rather than discovered later

- Automated timing scope is **five** binaries; the other **18** are execution- and
  schema-checked only, with no automated timing limit.
- CI's provisional slowdown threshold **must not exceed +50%** until the estimator
  characterisation in `.specify/ci209-bench-gate.md` §6a is satisfied. That ceiling is
  constitutional — widening it requires an amendment. **A green sentinel is not evidence of
  +5% compliance.**
- A per-change budget does not bound **cumulative drift** — repeated +4.9% steps each pass. A
  release-anchored comparand closing that hole is **required at v1.0**, not optional.
- ★ **No binary is currently promotable, and §6a's criterion is circular.** Eligibility needs a
  binary's A-vs-A spread over 20 `push:main` runs, but the workflow produces the A2 leg **only
  for rows already marked `paired`** — so an unpaired binary can never generate the evidence
  that would promote it. §2 therefore binds the obligation to the **evidence**, not the
  promotion: a characterisation lane collecting A-vs-A for unpaired candidates **must exist
  before the v1.0 library release**, and from then on eligible binaries must be paired at or
  before the next **library** release (never a constitution version).

Counts above (5 paired / 18 unpaired / 23 total) are **as of this entry's date**. Paired status
is irreversible and the set only grows, so treat them as a point-in-time record, not a standing
fact — the current set lives in `.specify/ci209-bench-gate.md`.

Implemented by PR #272 (`91abcc74`), which closes the instrumentation half of issue #263.
Amendment PR #285. Gate A returned **BLOCK three times**, and in each round the majority of the
new P1s were defects introduced by the previous round's fix:

- **round 1** — four P1s, including the MINOR misclassification corrected here;
- **round 2** — the first draft of §2a made *every* missing measurement a failure, which would
  have outlawed the candidate-only-addition path PR #272 had just spent two Gate B rounds
  building;
- **round 3** — §2a's replacement asserted a **buildability** predicate the classifier does not
  implement, declared the paired set "non-decreasing" while also permitting approved narrowing,
  and bound promotion to a criterion that cannot fire.

Every one of those was a rule the constitution stated and the code did not have. The corrected
text describes the shipped instrument and names its gaps as gaps.
