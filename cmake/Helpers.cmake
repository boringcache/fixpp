# ── GCC does not know the `clang::` attribute namespace (#439) ───────────────
#
# The tree spells `[[clang::lifetimebound]]` in hand-written headers AND the
# codegen emitter writes it into every generated accessor, so the diagnostic
# count is dominated by generated code and moves with each regeneration. GCC
# parses the attribute, cannot act on it, and says so with `-Wattributes` --
# which is ON BY DEFAULT, not part of -Wall. Without this suppression `-Werror`
# on GCC is unusable.
#
# ⚠️ SUPPRESSED BY ATTRIBUTE, NOT BY NAMESPACE. `-Wno-attributes=clang::` would
# also swallow a MISSPELLED attribute in that namespace -- `[[clang::lifetimebond]]`
# compiles silently under it, on the very lane that exists to be strict. Naming
# the one attribute keeps that diagnostic. Measured three ways on GCC 13.3:
#   -Wno-attributes=clang::lifetimebound + [[clang::lifetimebound]] -> silent
#   -Wno-attributes=clang::lifetimebound + [[clang::lifetimebond]]  -> STILL errors
#   -Wno-attributes=clang::              + [[clang::lifetimebond]]  -> swallowed
# `lifetimebound` is currently the ONLY clang:: attribute in the tree; a second
# one means adding a second entry here, deliberately. Re-derive the population:
#   grep -rhoE '\[\[clang::[a-zA-Z_]+' include src tests tools perf | sort -u
#
# ⚠️ CXX ONLY, via a generator expression. `add_compile_options` is
# directory-scoped and reaches every language; this repo has a C target
# (`mallocnesia`). A configuration pairing GNU C++ with a non-GNU C compiler
# would hand this GCC-only spelling to that compiler, which rejects it as an
# unknown warning option -- fatal under -Werror.
#
# ⚠️ THE SUPPORT CHECK IS A BEHAVIOURAL PROBE, NOT A VERSION NUMBER. An earlier
# draft refused GCC < 13, on the belief that the scoped `-Wno-attributes=` form
# arrived in 13. That is a claim about other people's compilers that nothing
# here can re-check, it was disputed as wrong for GCC 12, and a version test
# cannot see a backport or a vendor build anyway. So compile the attribute WITH
# the flag under -Werror and ask whether it is silent -- the property actually
# depended upon. ⚠️ A bare flag-ACCEPTANCE test would not do: GCC accepts an
# unknown `-Wno-*` silently unless some other diagnostic fires, so it would pass
# on a compiler where the suppression does nothing.
#
# ⚠️ THE GATE ON FIXPP_WERROR IS A CACHE DECISION, NOT A LOGICAL ONE -- the
# suppression is correct on GCC unconditionally. GCC can never act on a
# `clang::` attribute, with or without -Werror; read this as "applied where it
# is load-bearing", NOT as "only needed under -Werror".
#
# What the gate buys, measured rather than assumed. Adding a flag moves EVERY
# compile command line, so a lane's ccache restore still HITs while every entry
# misses -- the signature ci/ccache-stats.sh calls pathological. Two lanes
# assert a 70% FATAL floor: python-wheel-build (tier1.yml) and all four
# linux-clang-libc++* legs (tier3-libcxx.yml). The libc++ legs are clang, so
# this flag never reaches them. python-wheel-build is GNU and never sets
# FIXPP_WERROR, and its cache identity is the manylinux image digest + py-api,
# which does NOT cover the flag surface -- so it cannot rotate its own key and
# would take the full miss. Ungated, that lane breaches its floor with
# certainty; gated, its command lines are byte-identical.
#
# ⚠️ THE CONDITION, so this does not rot into a rule nobody can re-check: the
# gate is worth keeping only while some floored lane is GNU and does not set
# FIXPP_WERROR. Re-derive with
#   grep -rn "ccache-stats.sh" .github/workflows/   # which callers pass a floor
# and check that lane's compiler and FIXPP_WERROR. If no floored lane is GNU any
# more, DELETE the gate -- an unconditional suppression is the better mechanism.
# If a GCC lane without -Werror ever wants clean output, delete the gate and
# re-seed that lane's cache the way #437/#453 did (drop the stale GHCR tags so
# the restore MISSes, which the floor exempts).

# its CWD; without these a red replay litters the repo root with untracked files
# (observed while proving this instrument could go RED at all). A future edit to
# the artifact layout or the timeout is now one edit, not two that can drift

#
# A libFuzzer harness that no ctest replays is COMPILED by the fuzz lane
# (`FIXPP_BUILD_FUZZ=ON` on `linux-clang-asan`) and never executed: it stays
# green forever having run not one input. Nothing is missing, nothing errors, no
# job goes red — there is simply nothing to find. That is how #405's genuine hang
# in `fuzz_message_store` survived, and #213 closed only the neighbouring gap
# (inputs that existed but were never replayed).
#
# ⚠️ THE INVARIANT IS "A REPLAY EXISTS", NOT "A CORPUS DIRECTORY EXISTS".
# The first draft of this check tested `IS_DIRECTORY corpus/<name>/`, which is a
# PROXY for the property that matters and is true only for one of the two fuzz
# suites: tests/fuzz/ names inputs `corpus/<harness>/`, while tests/config/fuzz/
# names them `crashes/` and registers `fuzz_replay_toml_crashes` against
# `fuzz_toml_loader` — a corpus deliberately NOT named after its harness. A check
# written against the directory convention therefore could not be shared, and
# widening it to glob both trees would MISCOUNT while looking authoritative (the
# error #408 records from PR #407's first draft). Asking `fixpp_add_fuzz_replay`
# what it actually registered removes the coupling to any naming convention, so
# the same check serves both suites and keeps working if either renames its
# inputs.
#
# ⚠️ ENUMERATE FROM THE BUILDSYSTEM, NEVER FROM A HAND-WRITTEN LIST. A second
# list of harness names would be derived from the same `add_executable` calls it
# is meant to check, so it could never disagree with them — a tautology that
# reports PASS because it cannot report anything else. `BUILDSYSTEM_TARGETS` is
# the set of targets the calling directory actually defined, so a new harness is
# visible the moment it is written, whether or not its author knew this exists.
#
# ⚠️ CALL IT DEFERRED — `cmake_language(DEFER CALL ...)` — WHICH IS LOAD-BEARING.
# `BUILDSYSTEM_TARGETS` reports only the targets defined SO FAR, and appending a
# new `add_executable` to the end of a CMakeLists is the most natural way to add
# a harness. Called inline this check is silently GREEN for anything declared
# below it: that is not hypothetical, a forced arm proved exactly that against
# the inline first draft. The considered alternative was to fold the check into
# the corpus-registration loop, which by its position already runs after every
# harness is declared; it was rejected because that loop is keyed on corpus
# DIRECTORIES and inverting it would rewrite working registration code and still
# need a second pass to catch an orphan corpus. Deferring is the smaller change
# that makes placement stop mattering.
#
# The argument is the NAME of a list variable holding harness base-names (the
# target name minus its `fuzz_` prefix) deliberately shipped without a replay.
