# cmake/FixppMallocnesia.cmake — the allocation-discipline gate's interceptor and the
# one registration path for every gate that uses it (fixpp#448).
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The interceptor used to be a hand-built artifact:
# `make -C tools/mallocnesia` produced a gitignored `libmallocnesia.so`, and every gate
# was registered inside `if(EXISTS .../libmallocnesia.so)`. On any machine that had not
# run that make — every CI runner — the guarded entries were SILENTLY NEVER REGISTERED,
# and `--no-tests=error` could not notice because other tests still ran. A second group
# set LD_PRELOAD directly with no guard at all, and ld.so IGNORES an unloadable preload,
# so those ran uninstrumented and passed.
#
# Building it as a target removes the precondition rather than checking it: there is no
# longer a state in which the gates are registered against something that may not exist.
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCER. The hand-run Makefile and the source-tree artifact it
# built are deleted (fixpp#448), and tools/check_alloc.py no longer searches that
# path. The .so remains gitignored and is never committed: a prebuilt binary has to
# match the runner's libc and arch, cannot be reviewed, and becomes the thing someone
# must remember to refresh when mallocnesia.c changes — the same staleness in a new
# place. Only the source is tracked.
#
# ⚠️ Linux-only AND non-sanitizer BY CONSTRUCTION, not by preference. The mechanism is
# ELF LD_PRELOAD
# symbol interposition; macOS needs DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES + interpose sections and
# Windows has no equivalent. Callers must not "port" this by relaxing the guard —
# a gate that registers on a platform where interposition does not happen is a gate
# that passes without measuring, which is the whole defect class this file closes.

# ⚠️ NOT SUPPORTED UNDER A SANITIZER, AND THIS IS A CORRECTNESS CONDITION, NOT A COST
# ONE. A sanitizer installs its OWN allocator ahead of this interposer, so our malloc
# hook never fires: the gates then report "interception confirmed" and catch nothing —
# a vacuous pass, which is the exact defect class fixpp#448 exists to remove.
#
# MEASURED on linux-clang-asan, and it is worth stating precisely because the obvious
# guard does not catch it: the interceptor's CONSTRUCTOR RUNS (the witness file is
# written, so `check_alloc.py` is satisfied that a preload took effect) while the
# planted allocation is NOT intercepted. Constructor execution and symbol interposition
# are different facts, and only the positive control can tell them apart — it FAILS
# there, with "interception was active yet the planted allocation was not caught".
#
# So the gates must not REGISTER on a sanitizer build. Excluding them at the ctest
# selection instead would leave them registered and runnable — and the unfiltered
# full-ctest runs on those lanes would pick them up and pass vacuously.

  # ⚠️ `project()` declares `LANGUAGES CXX` only, so C is enabled HERE rather than

  # configure of every preset, including the Windows and macOS ones that never build
  # this target. Enabling it inside the platform guard keeps the cost where the need is.
  # `enable_language` is idempotent, so the call tests/capi/CMakeLists.txt already makes
  # for its own C sources is harmless — this module is included first, which merely makes
  # that one the redundant call rather than this one.

  # (An earlier revision of this comment justified the placement by claiming this is
