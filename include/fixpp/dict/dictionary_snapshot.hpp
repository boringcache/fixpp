// ⚠️ Superseded in part by `.specify/495-493-486-dict-reify-copy.md` §6 (D-4,
// fixpp#495, owner rulings R-B/R-C): the snapshot owns its table in the table's
// OWN control block, and shared_dictionary_view() hands out that owner instead of
// forming an aliasing pointer into the snapshot. A held view therefore keeps the
// table alive but neither the snapshot nor its Dictionary. 215's alias design
// (§3's helper, §5b's "third owner of the snapshot's control block", §6 seam 7's
// G2 count of one) is history; the pairing and the passkey below are unchanged.
//
// fixpp#215 item 1, Option C (`.specify/215-dictionary-view.md` §3) —
// `fixpp::dict::dictionary_snapshot`: an opaque, non-copyable, non-movable
// value object that pairs a `table_view` with the `Dictionary` it was built
// from. Replaces `SessionConfig::dictionary_view` (a bare
// `shared_ptr<const table_view>`), which had two defects (§2): C1 — the
// `const` on the pointee WAS not enforced, because `table_view` then carried
// its population surface in public (add_valid_tag, set_group_first,
// set_length_pair_data_tag, …), and a caller holding a non-const alias could
// repopulate a published view — and C4 — nothing checked that the view actually came
// from the paired `SessionConfig::dictionary`, so a mismatched pair silently
// drove inbound parsing/validation from the wrong grammar.
//
// C1 is closed AT THE INJECTION POINT by construction: the only way to seat
// a view on a `SessionConfig` is through `make_dictionary_snapshot`, and the
// object it returns exposes the view only with a `const` pointee —
// `table_view const&` from view(), `shared_ptr<const table_view>` from
// view_owner() — from a type that cannot be copied, moved, or value-constructed. C4 is rejected
// fail-closed at `Session::open()` (a runtime pointer-identity compare
// against `source()`, not a construction closure — see the design doc §3).
//
// `Dictionary::as_table_view()` (dictionary.hpp's own declaration) stays public and keeps
// returning a `table_view` BY VALUE — `dictionary_driven_validator` still holds one by
// value under the frozen SC-007 design point (validator.hpp's
// `dictionary_driven_validator` ctor). fixpp#456 sealed that view's population surface
// (`table_view.hpp`'s STORAGE banner); it is still returned by value into a non-`const`
// caller variable unless the caller declares otherwise. What this type does remains what
// it always did and is NOT subsumed by that seal — it is the PAIRING with the source
// `Dictionary` that closes C4, which the seal does not touch.
