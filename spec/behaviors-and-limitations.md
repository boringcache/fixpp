# Behaviors & Limitations

Cross-feature catalogue of **non-obvious intended behaviors** and **known limitations**
of the fixpp library. This is the **source of truth** that the operator/reference
documentation harvests into a consolidated *"Behaviors & Limitations"* section at
doc-build time (sibling to [`feature-catalogue.md`](./feature-catalogue.md); `prebuild.py`
whitelists `spec/*.md` into the mdBook `docs/src/`).

Scope and conventions:

- **Behavior (B-*)** = a deliberate, shipped behavior that is surprising, divergent from
  a naïve expectation, or divergent from another FIX engine — something a user/operator
  must know but would not guess. Each cites its origin feature + anchor.
- **Limitation (L-*)** = a known gap or sharp edge in shipped code. Carries a **Status**:
  `deferred` (intentional, tracked), `follow-up` (in the deferred-work registry), or
  `wontfix` (a documented divergence we stand behind). Limitations with a backlog item
  link to the **Deferred-work registry** in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Entries are added as each feature ships (Polish / catalogue step). **Prior features
  (001–014) were back-filled 2026-06-15** (draft — anchors cited from each `specs/<id>/spec.md` +
  `plan.md`; pending a verification pass at the operator-doc build). The out-of-band Fable 008 rows
  (`B-008-1`/`L-008-1`/`L-008-2`) were relocated into the 008 section as part of that back-fill.

## Decimal type (001-core-decimal)

> Anchor note: features 001–014 predate the FR-/SC- convention; rows cite the ids these
> specs actually use (`AC-*`, `NFR-*`, dated Clarifications, `§N`). Back-filled 2026-06-15.

### Behaviors

- **B-001-1 — Bare `fixpp_decimal_compare` / `_equal` do NO domain validation; the `_checked` siblings do.** The bare C-ABI entry points return `int` directly with no error channel and assume the caller already produced canonical values (`exponent ∈ [-38, 0]`) — feeding them an out-of-domain struct is undefined, not a reported error. Untrusted/foreign callers MUST use `fixpp_decimal_compare_checked` / `_equal_checked`, which validate and return `FIXPP_ERR_DECIMAL_INVALID` on out-of-domain input. C++ engine code calls the bare path by construction. *(AC-C6; Clarifications Session 2026-05-12.)*
- **B-001-2 — `.5` and `5.` are rejected, not parsed as 0.5 / 5.0.** A decimal literal with no integer digit (`.5`) or no fractional digit (`5.`) is `decimal_invalid_input`; any non-digit/non-dot/non-sign byte (including an embedded SOH `\x01`) is also rejected. A consumer expecting lenient `atof`-style parsing will be surprised. *(AC-P3 / AC-P4.)*
- **B-001-3 — The invalid sentinel sorts strictly greater than every finite value.** `pod_decimal_invalid` orders above all finite decimals and is equal only to itself, so a parse-failure sentinel never silently compares equal to a real price. Comparison is by numeric value, so `1`, `1.0`, `1.00` all compare equal. *(AC-C2 / AC-C1.)*
- **B-001-4 — Trailing fractional zeros are preserved in the encoding, but compare ignores them.** `5.500` parses to `{5500, -3}` (the exponent retains scale), yet value-equality treats it as equal to `5.5`. Storage is representation-faithful; comparison is value-faithful. *(AC-P5 / AC-C1.)*
- **B-001-5 — Swapping the decimal width is a build-time choice enforced at LINK time.** Setting `-DFIXPP_DECIMAL_T=...` widens the whole engine; two translation units built with conflicting `FIXPP_DECIMAL_T` fail with an unresolved-symbol *link* error (`decimal_alias_sentinel`), not a runtime mismatch. The alias never changes the `fixpp_decimal_t` C-ABI shape (always 16 bytes). *(AC-B3 / AC-B4.)*

- **B-351-1 — `ReconnectFsm::drive_reconnect_attempt()` discarded a cancellation emitted before it
  was entered, and connected anyway. Only asio's throw was stopping it.**

  The coroutine's first statement was `reset_cancellation_state(enable_total_cancellation())`, which
  re-constructs the state from the parent slot with `cancelled_` value-initialised — so an emission
  that already happened is not replayed, and BOTH reaps below it (the post-backoff one #349 fixed and
  the loop-head one #349 kept) observed `none`. The attempt then ran to a successful connect and
  handshake with the caller's cancellation gone.

  ⚠️ **This was invisible because asio masked it.** `await_transform` for a child awaitable throws
  `operation_aborted` at the CALLER's `co_await drive_reconnect_attempt()` when `throw_if_cancelled_`
  — default TRUE — sees the state already cancelled, so the body never ran and the reset never got
  the chance to discard anything. The masking is a POLICY the caller can switch off, not a property
  of the FSM: #351 proposed switching it off, which would have unmasked this.

  Fixed by #349's own rule applied at the coroutine head — reap BEFORE the reset, not instead of it.
  Both states are measured in `tests/session/test_reconnect_live_happy_path.cpp`: with the default
  policy the caller gets the throw and the body never runs; with `throw_if_cancelled(false)` the body
  runs and now answers `transport_connect_cancelled`. Deleting the head reap turns the second cell
  RED by letting the attempt connect — that is its mutation kill.

  ⚠️ This does NOT make `[2g §6.4]`'s `tls_load_cancelled` reachable from this caller, and L-349-1
  below still stands: `load_credentials()` is not entered on either path, and nothing suspends
  between the loop-head reap and the load at which a cancellation could arrive. An opt-out placed
  around the LOAD, as #351 proposed, would guard a window that cannot open.

### Limitations

- **L-001-1 — No arithmetic and no locale-aware formatting on `decimal<T>`.** No `+ - * /`, no thousands-separators / exponent-notation / per-locale decimal marks; it is a representation primitive only. **Status: wontfix.** *(spec §5 "Out of scope".)*
- **L-001-2 — No direct `T → U` cross-traits conversion; everything funnels through `pod_decimal`.** A value outside the `int64 × 10^[-38..0]` PoD interchange domain reports `decimal_precision_loss` rather than converting directly. **Status: deferred** (§10 Q1). *(spec §5 "Out of scope"; §10 Q1.)*
- **L-001-3 — No built-in `decimal_traits<__int128>` specialization.** High-precision consumers supply their own wider trait via `FIXPP_DECIMAL_USER_HEADER`; v1.0 ships no `__int128` trait. **Status: deferred** (§10 Q2). *(spec §5; §10 Q2.)*
- **L-001-4 — Exactly-representable values whose digit string is capacity-padded with trailing zeros are rejected as `decimal_overflow`.** Because the parser preserves every fractional digit into the mantissa (§6.1 step 5, AC-P5) and rejects int64 overflow (step 6), a padded form of an in-range value overflows even though its canonical form fits: `"1.0000000000000000000"` (1 + 19 zeros, value 1.0) and `"9223372036854775807.0"` (INT64_MAX with one decimal place) both report `decimal_overflow`, while `"1." + 18 zeros` and `"9223372036854775807"` parse fine. Counterparty-reachable via the opt-in inbound validator Float arm → per-field Reject (`373=5`); fail-closed availability quirk, not corruption. A strip-trailing-zeros-on-overflow retry would admit these but conflicts with the §6.1-step-5 preservation mandate — so **status: wontfix** (spec-forced consequence of AC-P5 + overflow rejection). *(§6.1 steps 5–6; AC-P5 / AC-P7 / AC-P8.)*

## XML data dictionary loader (002-dictionary-xml-loader)

### Behaviors

- **B-002-1 — The loader THROWS typed exceptions; a deliberate carve-out from the engine's noexcept/`expected_t` model.** `XmlLoader::load` returns a `Dictionary` by value and signals construction-time failure via typed exceptions — not `expected_t`. **Catch carefully:** `dict::xml_parse_error` and `dict::unknown_version_error` derive from `std::runtime_error`, but `dict::xml_oom_error` derives from `std::bad_alloc` (in `include/fixpp/dict/error.hpp`), NOT `std::runtime_error` — a `catch (std::runtime_error&)` silently MISSES the OOM path. The hot-path `Dictionary` accessors are then all `noexcept`. *(spec §1 Style note; AC-L2 / AC-L9; NFR-002-5; `include/fixpp/dict/error.hpp`.)*
- **B-002-2 — Walk a component's/group's fields via `component_fields()` / `group_fields()`, not by indexing `fields_`.** Under the runtime loader, `ComponentRef`/`GroupRef::first_field_index` index per-component/per-group SIDE TABLES, not the main `fields_` array (which is concatenated per `(message, field)` for O(log N) lookup), so components are not contiguous in it. This differs from the codegen-emitted layout where components ARE contiguous. *(Clarifications Session 2026-05-15 Q4.)*
- **B-002-3 — There is no context-free `field(tag)` lookup; field metadata is keyed by `(MsgType, tag)`.** One `FieldRef` exists per `(MsgType, tag)` pair (a field can carry a different presence rule per message), so a bare `field(tag)` has no canonical answer and is not in the v1.0 surface. Unknown tags return `field_presence::NotDeclared`, not an error. *(AC-D1 / AC-D2.)*
- **B-002-4 — `messages()` iteration order is bytewise-lexicographic by MsgType, locale-independent.** Ordering is fixed by `std::ranges::lexicographical_compare` over `unsigned char`, so the same XML yields a byte-stable order across runs and machines — not the host locale's collation. *(AC-D5; NFR-002-4.)*

### Limitations

- **L-002-1 — Only the four codegen-target versions (FIX42/44/50SP2/FIXT11) ship XML + headline tests.** The loader structurally accepts all nine v1.0 versions, but the five runtime-XML-only ones (FIX 4.0/4.1/4.3/5.0/5.0SP1) ship no checked-in XML data; supplying them is ~1 PR of data each, no loader code. **Status: deferred** (§10 F1). *(Clarifications Session 2026-05-14 Q1.)*
- **L-002-2 — `DialectOverlay` / `load_overlay*` is absent.** Per-session venue-dialect extension of a base dictionary is not in this feature. **Status: deferred** (§10 F2, dedicated feature). *(Clarifications Session 2026-05-14 Q2.)*
- **L-002-3 — Semantically-inconsistent-but-structurally-valid XML is accepted; only structural defects are caught.** A `<message>` referencing a field with a wrong-for-usage type is NOT a loader error; semantic validation belongs to `wire::Validator` downstream. **Status: wontfix.** *(spec §3 Edge Cases.)*
- **L-002-4 — Zero-allocation covers only the output `Dictionary` metadata, not pugixml's transient DOM.** pugixml's intermediate DOM uses `malloc/free` (not `operator new`); peak parser-side memory is not bounded by the NFR-002-2 gate. **Status: wontfix.** *(NFR-002-2.)*

## Dictionary codegen + typed messages + reify bridge (003-dictionary-codegen)

### Behaviors

- **B-003-1 — Typed-message accessors are `inline noexcept`, NOT `constexpr`.** Only `msg_type_v` / `version_v` are `constexpr`; per-tag accessors route through `wire::OffsetTable::find` (non-`constexpr`). The catalogue's "constexpr accessors" title is looser than what ships. *(AC-G11; spec §1 Style note.)*
- **B-003-2 — The decimal accessor alone takes an explicit `std::pmr::memory_resource* mr`; string/int/char accessors are zero-arg.** A typed decimal read is `price(mr)` returning `expected_t<decimal_t>` (zero-alloc for the default `pod_decimal`; an allocating substituted `FIXPP_DECIMAL_T` draws from `mr`, never raw `new`). `decimal_t` is deliberately NOT a `field_traits` specialization. *(AC-G4 / AC-G4a / AC-FT2.)*
- **B-003-3 — Codegen runs at CONFIGURE time and writes only to the build tree, never the source tree.** `fixpp::dict::generate-vXX` emits per-version headers under `build/<preset>/_codegen/...`; a source checkout never carries generated headers, so a dirty tree never ships stale codegen. Output is byte-identical run-to-run. *(AC-T1 / AC-T2 / AC-C4.)*
- **B-003-4 — `owning_<Msg>` is single-strand-only; the safe cross-thread pattern is reify-on-A → move → consume-on-B.** The lazy `view()` cache write is unsynchronized, so concurrent reads on one `owning_<Msg>` instance are UB. To cross a strand boundary, `dict::reify_as` on thread A, `std::move` the owner to thread B, then read. *(AC-T3 / AC-R5.)*
- **B-003-5 — A FIXT.1.1 message that can't resolve its application version returns a distinct error, not "unknown msg type".** When `default_appl == Unknown` and a frame lacks `ApplVerID(1128)`, `dict::reify` returns `dict_unresolved_application_version` (NOT `dict_reify_unknown_msg_type`). *(AC-D6; `resolve_application_version` in `src/dictionary/version_profile.cpp`, propagated in `src/dictionary/reify.cpp`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-003-1 — Typed messages + compile-time shape ship; the BEHAVIORAL reify/typed-read round-trip is now PARTIALLY unblocked (057).** The `owning_<Msg>` emission + compile-time shape landed at 003. **057 (2026-07-01) lifts the runtime half:** `dict::reify()` returns live `owning_message_handle`s with byte-faithful `version()` / `msg_type()` / `field_value()` for application (single- **and** multi-char MsgType) and FIXT-admin frames across v42/v44/v50sp2, and `dict::reify_as<Msg>()` returns concrete typed `owning_<Msg>` owners. **Still deferred:** the `owning_message_handle::as<Msg>()` typed-downcast half remains **AC-R6-deferred / T059-stubbed** — a still-live deferred contract, not shipped (byte storage does not foreclose a future lazily-populated owner-cache). **Status: PARTIAL** (runtime `reify`/`reify_as` shipped 057; `as<Msg>()` AC-R6-deferred). *(spec §5 last bullet; §11 R6; 057 spec/plan.)*
- **L-003-2 — Only the four codegen-target versions get typed namespaces; runtime-XML-only versions have none.** For those, `dict::reify` returns `dict_reify_unknown_msg_type`; the positive path is 002's runtime `view.get(uint16_t)`. **Status: deferred** (§10 F5). *(spec §5; §10 F5.)*
- **L-003-3 — The codegen-emitted `Validator.hpp` is shape-tested only; it does not actually reject bad messages.** This feature ships the per-message rule tables + Length/Data pair table and asserts their structure against the XML, but behavioral validation is a downstream wire-layer feature (and the hand-written `wire::Validator` it complements has no production caller — see B-004-1 / B-005-7). **Status: deferred.** *(Clarifications Session 2026-05-15 Q3; AC-V3; spec §5.)*
- **L-003-4 — The all-versions translation unit is NOT a supported default build.** The load-bearing ceiling is the single-version TU (≤ 3 s); the all-versions TU carries only a soft ≤ 15 s ceiling. **Status: wontfix.** *(NFR-003-2; spec §5.)*

## Wire codec — framer, parser, offset table, writer, validator (004-wire-codec)

### Behaviors

- **B-004-1 — Field parsing is order-independent; the only ordering rule the `wire::Validator` enforces is "MsgType(35) first after framing" — and that validator is NOT invoked on the session inbound path.** The parser indexes fields by tag (O(1)-by-tag, no positional requirement). The hand-written `wire::Validator::validate` enforces one order rule — the first non-framing offset-table entry must be `MsgType(35)`, else `wire_header_out_of_order` (in `include/fixpp/wire/validator.hpp`). By default, `Session::on_inbound_frame` scans frames directly via `scan_frame_header` and does not run `dictionary_driven_validator`, so out-of-order header/body fields are accepted on the live session path (see B-005-7); fixpp does not enforce full FIX-SL §4.5 field-block ordering on the default path. **Updated (041):** `dictionary_driven_validator` is NO LONGER caller-less — 041 wired it onto the live inbound path under the opt-in `SessionConfig::validate_inbound_messages=true` (default `false`), which Rejects out-of-order header fields; see **B-041-1** (the `dictionary_driven_validator` construction in `src/session/session.cpp`). *(FR-002; `Validator::validate` in `include/fixpp/wire/validator.hpp`; error `wire_header_out_of_order` (39).)*
- **B-004-2 — CheckSum verification is mandatory with no production bypass switch.** A wrong `CheckSum(10)` or inconsistent `BodyLength(9)` is always rejected before any parser sees the frame — there is no "skip checksum" config knob (only a tests-only hook). Several FIX engines expose checksum-leniency toggles; fixpp does not. *(FR-017; spec §Edge Cases; `specs/004-wire-codec/plan.md`.)*
- **B-004-3 — DoS caps reject some conformant venue traffic on day one by default.** Default bounds (256 KiB max frame, 4096 offset-table occurrences, 4096 group entries/instance) target FX/equities; a large options-chain MDIR or `SecurityList` (thousands of strikes) exceeds the defaults and is rejected (`wire_frame_too_large` / `wire_offset_table_full`). Such venues must explicitly raise the caps. *(FR-015; Assumptions; SC-003.)*
- **B-004-4 — A parsed view aliases the caller's buffer and traps (debug) on use-after-reuse.** `MessageView`/`field_view` are zero-copy flyweights whose lifetime is the caller-owned buffer's; a debug-only generation counter traps deterministically if the buffer is reused under a live view (compiled out in release). *(FR-016; Key Entities "View"; `[const §IX.4]`.)*
- **B-004-5 — Unknown/custom fields are preserved opaquely and round-trip byte-identically.** Tags absent from the dictionary are not dropped/rejected at parse; they are exposed via `unknown_fields()` and written back in original byte order on re-serialize (zero-alloc), so parse→serialize is byte-identical including custom fields. *(FR-008; SC-001; Entity E9 `unknown_fields_view` in `specs/004-wire-codec/data-model.md`.)*
- **B-004-6 — A `Length`+`Data` field whose declared byte count does not land on a `SOH` field boundary is now rejected (Index); it was previously absorbed. Iter is best-effort and differs (below).** Per `[FIX50SP2 §3]` a `Length` tag (e.g. `RawDataLength(95)`) gives the *exact* byte count of the paired `Data` value (`RawData(96)`), and the byte immediately after that value must be `SOH`. A declared length that runs past the frame end, whose end byte is not `SOH`, or that lands **exactly** at the frame end (no trailing `SOH` at all, silently swallowing the trailing `10=CheckSum` field into the Data value) is a lying/malformed length — for this whole-frame scanner a legitimate counted value can never reach the frame's last byte, because a Framer-validated frame always has a trailing checksum field after the body. **Index mode** (the live session ingest path) now rejects such a frame with `wire_invalid_field_format` in all three cases instead of blindly skipping and desyncing into the following field (which silently hid or corrupted downstream fields, or swallowed the checksum). The pending `Length→Data` association is also required to be *adjacent*: if the field immediately after a `Length` tag is not its paired `Data` tag, the pending count is cleared (a later same-`Data`-tag field is no longer read by a stale count). Length/count scans are bounded (saturating) so an over-large declared value cannot wrap `uint32`/`size_t`. This closes a parser-differential vs conformant peers and the latent 32-bit heap-OOB escalation. **Iter mode** (`field_iterator`, no error channel, L-004-5) differs:
  - it stops iteration only when the count lands on a non-`SOH` byte inside its span;
  - a count that runs past the span is clamped to the span end;
  - a count that ends exactly at the span end is accepted. The C-ABI group read hands Iter a group slice, and the slice excludes the entry's terminal `SOH` (B-426-1).
  *(wire-hostile-input-review W-P2-1; Gate B PR #166 round-1 Finding 1 (`end == n` closed); `src/wire/offset_table.cpp` build; `include/fixpp/wire/tag_scan.hpp` `accumulate_bounded`.)*

- **B-004-7 — A repeating-group count field of zero (`NoXXX=0`) is accepted as a well-formed present-but-empty group, not rejected as a malformed group.** The `dictionary_driven_validator` short-circuits the group-structure check when the declared count is `0` (`consume_group`'s `declared_count == 0` arm in `include/fixpp/wire/validator.hpp`), so a message carrying e.g. `NoHops(627)=0` followed by a non-member field validates OK, the trailing field is read as a normal scalar (not walked into the group), and the offset-table / `group_view` yields zero entries; the count field re-encodes byte-identically. This mirrors QuickFIX-cpp acceptance test 21 (`RepeatingGroupSpecifierWithValueOfZero`, CBOEDirect semantics), adopted as conformance fixture TC-018. NOTE the short-circuit also *tolerates* a declared-zero-but-members-present frame (the `actual_count == declared_count` equality check is skipped for count `0`), consistent with the accept-empty-group intent. *(TC-018; `consume_group`'s `declared_count == 0` arm in `include/fixpp/wire/validator.hpp`; witnesses `validator_per_version_test.cpp::ZeroCountGroupAccepted` (all 4 wire versions, mutation-proven) + `round_trip_property_test.cpp::ZeroCountGroupPreservedByteIdentical`; dict-aware empty-group reads already witnessed by `GroupEntryRead.EmptyGroupSizeZeroNoDeref`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-004-1 — Dialect-introduced new `Length`+`Data` (BLOB) pairs are not handled on the streaming iterator path.** Index mode resolves all dialect BLOB pairs via the runtime dictionary, but Iter (streaming) mode uses a static `constexpr` table of FIX-5.0-SP2-standard pairs only. **Status: deferred.** *(FR-005; research D-11.)*
- **L-004-2 — Binary encodings (FIXP / SOFH / SBE) are out of scope; v1.0 is Tag=Value SOH only.** **Status: deferred.** *(spec §Assumptions.)*
- **L-004-3 — The wire layer adds no C-ABI surface; the 13 new `wire_*` variants' C-ABI coalescing is deferred to feature 2i.** **Status: deferred.** *(FR-014; the `[const §X.4]` row in `specs/004-wire-codec/plan.md`.)*
- **L-004-4 — Framing errors are session-fatal; there is NO in-stream resync-and-continue (diverges from FIX-TC 2d / QuickFIX).** When the framer rejects bytes (bad BeginString/BodyLength/checksum framing), the engine read-pump terminates the session (`run_read_pump`'s `stop_pump()` call on a framer-feed failure, `src/session/engine.cpp`) rather than skipping the garbled region and rescanning. NOTE: a too-high *sequence* gap on a *well-framed* frame is NOT fatal — it triggers ResendRequest recovery (B-013-1); this is specifically about byte-level framing corruption. **Status: wontfix** (fail-closed on a corrupt transport stream). *(`src/wire/framer.cpp`; `run_read_pump` in `src/session/engine.cpp`; FIX-TC coverage-audit 2026-06-15.)*
- **L-004-5 — The streaming `Iter` (`parse_iter`) mode is best-effort with NO error channel: a malformed field truncates iteration silently (no `malformed()` signal).** Unlike Index mode — which surfaces every malformation via `build_status()` and is the path the live session uses (`Session::on_inbound_frame` → `Parser<Index>`) — `field_iterator::advance()` reacts to a non-digit tag byte, a tag overflow, a missing `=`, or a `Length`+`Data` `SOH`-boundary mismatch (B-004-6) by ending iteration (`done_=true`) with no indication the frame was malformed. A direct `parse_iter` consumer therefore sees a truncated field set indistinguishable from a legitimately short message and must treat a short stream as suspect. Additionally, Iter does not replicate Index's empty-tag reject: a field `=value<SOH>` (no tag digits) yields a `tag == 0` field and iteration **continues**, whereas Index rejects the whole frame with `wire_invalid_field_format` (the `i == tag_start` guard). The range-for **does** always terminate on such input (a `done_` iterator compares equal to `end()`), so there is no hang; the limitation is only the absent error signal. **Status: documented (defense-in-depth); not prod-reachable** — production ingest is Index-only. *(wire-hostile-input-review W-P2-2; Gate B PR #166 round-2 P3 (empty-tag divergence, document-not-fix); `include/fixpp/wire/parser.hpp` `advance`/`operator==`.)*
- **L-004-6 — The `OffsetTable` open-address overlay uses a per-process-randomised hash seed, so the internal slot layout differs across processes (immaterial to observable behavior).** `find(tag)` / `entries()` / document order are unchanged; the seed only randomises the internal probe sequence to defeat a crafted hash-collision that would otherwise force a present required field to read false-absent (a predictable-`mix()` HashDoS). A test/fuzz hook (`detail::set_overlay_seed_for_testing`) pins the seed for reproducibility; production randomises it once per process. **Status: by design.** *(wire-hostile-input-review W-P3-2; `src/wire/offset_table.cpp` `mix`/`compute_process_seed`.)*

## Session establishment & FSM core (005-session-establishment-fsm)

### Behaviors

- **B-005-2 — There is no `RecoveryPending` half-state; the FSM is exactly the 6-state `[FIX-SL §4.10]` set.** `NotConnected → LogonSent → LogonReceived → Active → LogoutSent → Disconnected`, no invented states (a Gate-A survey found the OSS premise behind a proposed half-state was inverted). *(FR-001; Session-2026-05-18; Key Entities.)*
- **B-005-3 — Receipt of a deferred admin type (`ResendRequest`/`SequenceReset`) is a defined, bounded transition — never a silent no-op.** Even where gap-fill/resend was out of 005 scope, the FSM dispositions these (session-level `Reject` or the defined transition), never UB and never silently ignored. *(FR-017; spec §Edge Cases.)*
- **B-005-4 — `seqnum_t` overflow is session-fatal and requires operator intervention; it never silently wraps.** At the max representable outbound counter the session reports a fatal sequence-overflow rather than wrapping to zero. *(FR-009; spec §Edge Cases.)*
- **B-005-5 — Outbound sequence numbers are committed to the `MessageStore` BEFORE the frame hits transport (durable-before-transmit).** A cancelled transmit must not leave a persisted-but-unsent gap inconsistent with the contract. *(FR-010; `[2e §root cause #1]`.)*
- **B-005-6 — `HeartBtInt=0` fully disables heartbeating (no timers run at all).** When negotiated at Logon, neither heartbeat nor test-request timers run; the session is Active but emits no liveness traffic, per `[FIX-SL §4.3.4]`. *(FR-006.)*
- **B-005-7 — The live session inbound path accepts out-of-order header/body fields (incl. MsgType not first); it does NOT emit a Reject for field-order violations.** `Session::on_inbound_frame` scans fields order-independently (`scan_frame_header`) and never runs the `wire::Validator` MsgType-first check (B-004-1), so a frame with `MsgSeqNum(34)` before `MsgType(35)`, or with body fields shuffled, is accepted and processed (seqnum advances) — diverging from QuickFIX, which emits `Reject(SessionRejectReason=14)`. **[RATIFY RESOLVED 2026-06-19]** — the lenient order-independent parse is **retained as the default** (benign for well-formed frames — valid framing, required fields present — and not a forged-tag/delimiter vector); operators needing QuickFIX-parity strict §4.5 enforcement opt in via `SessionConfig::validate_inbound_messages=true` (041 / **B-041-1**), which Rejects out-of-order header fields with `373=14` (witnessed `tests/session/test_validate_gate_inbound.cpp` W1). Both modes are pinned. *(FIX-TC 2t/15 coverage-audit 2026-06-15; lenient default witnessed `tests/interop/parity/fix_tc_coverage_gaps_test.cpp` (HeaderFieldsOutOfOrder / BodyFieldsArbitraryOrder); see `fix-tc-coverage-gaps-findings.md`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-005-1 — The full `[FIX-TC]` conformance corpus is NOT satisfied; only a capability-partitioned subset ships green.** Recovery-dependent and too-high-seqnum TC cases are deferred-with-traceability; `[const §VII.5]` is explicitly NOT satisfied under a recorded waiver. **Status: deferred.** *(FR-018; SC-008; Session-2026-05-18.)*
- **L-005-5 — `OnBehalfOfCompID(115)`/`DeliverToCompID(128)` third-party addressing is not implemented; only point-to-point 49/56 validation.** **Status: deferred.** *(FR-004 scope note.)*

## Session FSM finalize (009-session-fsm-finalize)

### Behaviors

- **B-009-1 — Acceptor sessions stay in `NotConnected` at `open()` and emit no outbound Logon; only initiators emit at open.** With `role = acceptor`, `Session::open` waits for a peer `Logon` (then `NotConnected → LogonReceived → Active`). The pre-009 impl unconditionally entered `LogonSent` regardless of role. `role` defaults to `initiator`. *(FR-004/FR-005; the `role` field row in `specs/009-session-fsm-finalize/data-model.md`.)*
- **B-009-2 — A refused first `Logon` in `NotConnected` transitions to `Disconnected`, not back to `NotConnected`.** A failed BeginString/CompID/establishment validation moves the FSM to `Disconnected` per the matrix. *(FR-006; the `role` field row in `specs/009-session-fsm-finalize/data-model.md`.)*
- **B-009-3 — Missing OR malformed inbound `SendingTime(52)` is rejected, not leniently accepted.** In `Active`/`LogonReceived`, absent/unparseable `52` → `Reject(SessionRejectReason=10, RefTagID=52)` → `Logout` → `Disconnected`; in `LogonSent`, instead a `Logout(58=…)` with no standalone Reject. The prior lenient fall-through was removed. *(FR-007/FR-008/FR-009; the INBOUND doc-comment in `include/fixpp/session/sending_time.hpp`; `Session::on_inbound_frame`'s SendingTime-accuracy Reject arms in `src/session/session.cpp`.)*
- **B-009-4 — Every outbound frame (incl. all 5 admin builders) carries the negotiated `BeginString` and a live-clock `SendingTime`, not hard-coded placeholders.** The hard-coded `"FIX.4.2"` and zero-timestamp placeholder constants were removed. *(FR-002/FR-003.)*
- **B-009-5 — In `LogoutSent` (graceful logout in progress) all inbound frames except the peer's `Logout(35=5)` are silently drained.** An inbound Logon (or any app/admin frame) received while awaiting the peer's Logout confirmation does NOT advance the inbound seqnum, is NOT Rejected, and does NOT re-establish — only the peer's Logout is acted upon (→ Disconnected). Diverges from QuickFIX, which treats a second Logon in this state as valid. *(the `case fsm_state::LogoutSent` drain arm in `src/session/session.cpp`; FIX-TC coverage-audit 2026-06-15; `tests/interop/parity/fix_tc_coverage_gaps_test.cpp`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-009-1 — A `Session::send` whose transport `async_write` is cancelled after the store commit leaves a durable-but-unsent frame; 009 does not recover it.** The slice returns a defined error and reaches `Disconnected` (no silent success) but performs no session-level recovery of the phantom committed frame. **Status: deferred.** *(spec §Edge Cases; `[2e §3.1]`.)*
- **L-009-2 — TestRequest ID uniqueness is per-session-lifetime only and wraps at `UINT32_MAX`.** Not unique across sessions or restarts; wrap-around is acceptable. **Status: wontfix.** *(FR-010.)*
- **L-009-3 — `SeqnumManager::drain` failure during `close` is logged-then-proceed, not surfaced as a close error.** Still reports `closed_drained`; the destructor completes safely. **Status: wontfix.** *(FR-011.)*

## Session config & lifetime (010-session-cfg-lifetime)

### Behaviors

- **B-010-1 — `Session` copies its `SessionConfig` by value at construction; the caller may drop or mutate the config afterward.** `Session` holds `SessionConfig cfg_` by value (was a `const&`, a stack-use-after-scope hazard). Each `Session` owns its snapshot; post-construction mutation of the caller's config has no effect, and config sharing across sessions is unsupported (construct one config per session). *(FR-001; Clarification 2026-05-23; Key Entities.)*
- **B-010-2 — `Session::send` in a non-`Active` state returns a dedicated `session_invalid_state_for_send` error, distinct from `session_invalid_logon`.** 010 added slot 77 to de-conflate the two conditions; FSM-side Logon-refusal still uses `session_invalid_logon`. *(FR-005; SC-004.)*
- **B-010-3 — A duplicate `Logon` (`35=A`) in `Active` emits exactly one `Reject(35=3)` — a deliberate defensive divergence from QuickFIX's refresh-on-dup-Logon convention.** `"A"` is deliberately excluded from `is_admin_msgtype`, so it falls through to a single Reject per 005 FR-017 ("never silent no-op"). NOTE: `ResendRequest("2")` and `SequenceReset("4")` in `Active` are **no longer Rejected** — they were upgraded to full processing by 013 (Phase 3) / S-023 and explicitly no longer reach the Reject branch. *(FR-006/FR-008; SC-002; the dup-Logon `!detail::is_admin_msgtype(hdr.msg_type)` Reject arm in `src/session/session.cpp`.)*
- **B-010-4 — The `LogonReceived` FSM state is synchronous-transient; observe it via the always-on history ring buffer.** On the acceptor reply-Logon path the FSM passes `NotConnected → LogonReceived → Active` in one tick, so `LogonReceived` cannot be caught by a state snapshot; `Session::fsm_visit_history()` (a 16-entry ring, always written) is the only observation seam. No `#ifdef` divergence between production and test. *(FR-004; SC-002.)*

### Limitations

- **L-010-1 — The `Active×ResendRequest` / `Active×SequenceReset` Reject→Process upgrade has LANDED (013 / S-023 / 027 / 029); only the dup-Logon-in-`Active` cell still Rejects by design.** What 010 shipped as `TODO(2e-recovery)` Reject cells are now fully processed (ResendRequest → `replay_outbound_range_`; SequenceReset → Reset-mode bypass + GapFill arms), staying Active. Catalogue row 400 is thereby largely discharged; the residual is a v1.0-gate traceability-marker confirm. **Status: follow-up** (was deferred — now shipped). *(SC-002; the `replay_outbound_range_` / SequenceReset arms in `src/session/session.cpp`.)*
- **L-010-2 — The `cfg_` member is not type-`const`; "no post-ctor mutation" is convention-enforced, not compiler-enforced.** Held non-const to preserve future config-hot-reload flexibility. **Status: wontfix.** *(FR-001.)*
- **L-010-3 — `SessionConfig::store_factory` is a `shared_ptr` (a small 005 amendment) to make `SessionConfig` copy-constructible.** The per-Session "one MessageStore per Session" invariant is unaffected. **Status: wontfix.** *(FR-001a; `include/fixpp/session/session_config.hpp`.)*

## Awaitable mutex `fixpp::sync::async_mutex` (006-async-mutex)

### Behaviors

- **B-006-1 — `async_mutex` is the only legal mutex in any coroutine context; plain `std::mutex` is banned and CI-enforced.** Any header that includes `asio::awaitable<...>` and also names a `std::` mutex spelling fails the build with a diagnostic pointing at `fixpp::sync::async_mutex`. A custom-`MessageStore` author migrating from QuickFIX must swap `std::mutex` for `async_mutex`. *(FR-014 / SC-006 / US5.)*
- **B-006-2 — Destroying a mutex that still has a live holder or waiters calls `std::terminate()` by design — it is not an error return.** A documented hard precondition (RC#3), enforced in both debug and release; teardown must `cancel_and_drain()` first. *(FR-008; spec §Edge Cases.)*
- **B-006-3 — Waiter resumption is always `post`ed, never inline-`dispatch`ed, regardless of `completion_policy`.** The `completion_policy` survives only as an intent knob queryable via `policy()`; an inline `dispatch` at the resume site was a TSan-diagnosed heap-UAF (Erratum E-3). A caller expecting `dispatch`-policy inline resumption will not get it. *(FR-004; US1.3.)*

### Limitations

- **L-006-1 — No shared/RW, recursive, or timed mutex variant; LIFO-pop + FIFO-drain is the only fairness mode, and there is no public `try_lock()`.** Recursive acquire by the current holder is unsupported by construction. **Status: wontfix.** *(FR-015; spec §Edge Cases.)*
- **L-006-2 — Zero-global-allocation on the contended path holds only in steady state, after a one-time per-thread cancellation-recycler warm-up.** asio's `cancellation_slot` exposes no allocator-binding hook; the one-time first-touch is amortized and bench-soft (Erratum E-4). **Status: wontfix.** *(FR-009 / SC-004.)*

## Application threading contract & `fixpp::core::Clock` (007-threading-clock)

### Behaviors

- **B-007-1 — Application callbacks are serialised per session on an engine-derived strand and never run on the I/O recv thread.** `onLogon`/`onLogout`/`toAdmin`/`fromAdmin`/`toApp`/`fromApp` for one session never overlap; callbacks for *different* sessions may run concurrently. The engine never picks a concrete executor — the application supplies one `any_io_executor`. *(FR-007/FR-008; US1.)*
- **B-007-3 — `now()` is not promised monotonic; all elapsed/heartbeat/SendingTime-*delta* (threshold) measurements use `steady_now()`.** A benign NTP/admin backward wall-clock step never trips a SendingTime-threshold reject; wall-clock `now()` is consulted for the actual `SendingTime(52)` wire stamp (`stamp_sending_time` in `src/session/session.cpp`) and log/OTel timestamps — NOT for interval/threshold deltas. Diverges from engines that measure heartbeat intervals against wall-clock. *(FR-004; US2.3.)*
- **B-007-4 — Opting out of the per-session strand requires explicit attestation, and `direct_executor + spin` is rejected even when attested.** `threading_mode::direct_executor` skips the `make_strand` wrap but demands `already_serialized_executor == true`, else `error::executor_not_serialised`; `direct_executor` + `lock_policy::spin` is rejected with `error::invalid_session_config`. *(FR-009; US1.4.)*
- **B-007-5 — `drop_oldest` backpressure is unrepresentable.** `backpressure_mode` is a closed enum with only `block` (default) and `disconnect_and_recover`; an out-of-range cast is rejected at construction (`[const §XV.15]` no silent loss). *(FR-010; US5.3.)*
- **B-007-6 — Trace context follows the session serialisation domain, not `thread_local`, and survives resume on a different thread.** `co_await fixpp::current_trace_context` recovers a typed `Session*` and reads a `session_local<trace_context>` slot, byte-identical across a suspend/resume on another pool thread. *(FR-014/FR-015; US4.)*
- **B-007-7 — Engine/session config is frozen at open; the only reconfiguration path is close-and-reopen.** Executor, clock, dictionary, mode, locks, trace-context all freeze via `resolved = override.value_or(engine_anchor)`. *(FR-016; US5.1.)*

### Limitations

- **L-007-1 — `Session::close(partial)` is not in the v1.0 surface; only `graceful` and `terminal` ship.** **Status: deferred.** *(FR-011; Key Entities "close_mode".)*
- **L-007-2 — `direct_executor` attested over a genuinely non-serialised executor is UB in release builds.** Debug trips a strand-invariant assert on detected concurrent FSM entry; release treats a false attestation as user-contract-violation UB. **Status: wontfix.** *(spec §Edge Cases; FR-009.)*
- **L-007-3 — The cross-thread dispatch latency ceiling (250 ns) is regression-gated, not an absolute hard-fail.** CI fails only on >5% regression vs the previous tagged release; the absolute figure is a §10-Q4 tightening target. **Status: follow-up.** *(SC-004; FR-021.)*

## Message store — async API + `MemoryStore` / `FileStore` (008-message-store)

### Behaviors

- **B-008-1 — The FileStore log grows monotonically until a reset epoch (size disk accordingly).** FileStore is append-only with no compaction, rotation, or size cap: each outbound message appends ≈ `payload + 16 B` record header (+ ≤ 7 B alignment padding) and each inbound advance a 24 B counter record (16 B header + 8 B payload). The only reclamation is a reset epoch (`reset_on_{logon,logout,disconnect}` — all default `false` — or bilateral `141=Y`). Default config ⇒ monotone growth for the durable session lifetime (restart re-scans the full log). fixpp has no `SessionTime`-driven daily auto-reset. **Operator action:** size disk for one reset epoch and enable a reset knob or arrange external EOD resets. *(Fable `5.4`; `src/session/file_store.cpp`'s `kHeaderSize` (=16), record-size computation, and append path; `src/session/file_store_factory.cpp`.)*
- **B-008-2 — The *default* `MemoryStore` config is rejected at construction under the *default* 1 GiB cap, by design.** The frozen defaults (`inbound = outbound = 10'000` × 256 KiB `max_frame_bytes` ≈ 5 GiB worst case) deliberately exceed `EngineConfig::max_store_memory_per_session = 1 GiB`, so a default `MemoryStoreFactory::make()` returns `store_factory_failed` and the session does not open — the operator must raise the cap or lower `max_frame_bytes`. *(FR-014a / SC-004; US2 scenario 2a; `include/fixpp/session/memory_store.hpp`, `include/fixpp/core/engine_config.hpp`, `include/fixpp/session/memory_store_factory.hpp`.)*
- **B-008-3 — `MemoryStore` is test/embedded-only; production deployments must use `FileStore` (or a custom impl).** `MemoryStore` never persists and survives no host crash; there is no "production in-memory store." *(spec §Key Entities S-012; US1.)*
- **B-008-4 — `store_seqnum_overflow` is session-fatal and the store never autonomously resets.** At `seqnum_max`, `next_seqnum(increment)` returns `store_seqnum_overflow`, does not increment, and the session cannot send until `reset()`; the operator chooses `reset()` + `141=Y` vs sticky abort. The store never silently rolls over. *(FR-022; spec §Edge Cases.)*
- **B-008-5 — `Session::close(terminal)` deliberately skips the FileStore durability flush, so terminal close can lose up to N-1 batched records.** `FileStore::flush_for_session_close()` runs only under `close(graceful)` (before the Logout write); `close(terminal)` skips phase 1, leaving the documented `commit_batched(N)` up-to-N-1-record window unflushed. *(FR-028; US2 scenarios 4–5.)*
- **B-008-6 — QuickFIX `MessageStore` migration is Path B only: no runtime adapter ships.** v1.0 ships a documented incompatibility + 5-step recipe + a config-translation `cfg_loader`, but no adapter wrapping a synchronous `quickfix::MessageStore` (the five hazards compose and cannot be safely fenced). A compile-time guard rejects any implicit sync-shaped construction. *(FR-030/FR-032; US4.)*
- **B-008-7 — `MemoryStore::retrieve()` fails closed with `store_io_failure` on a `reset()` that runs mid-traversal (both capacity policies).** A `reset()` interleaved with an in-flight `retrieve()` walk (during a `visitor.on_frame()` suspension) bumps a per-instance reset epoch (`generation_`, snapshotted under the writer mutex at walk start and re-checked before each frame with no `co_await` between the check and the byte read); a stale epoch stops the walk with `store_io_failure` rather than replaying a slot the concurrent `reset()`+`store()` may have overwritten. Bounded frames are additionally materialised into a private scratch buffer before `on_frame()`, so a mid-suspension overwrite cannot corrupt the visitor's own view. Mirrors FileStore's `generation_` guard (`B-035-1`) and the `message_store.hpp` contract ("mid-traversal mutation is detected … without UB"). Production is bounded by the single-session-strand discipline (serial `on_inbound_frame` cannot interleave a `reset()` mid-resend) → defense-in-depth for a future async caller; **the unbounded policy, previously silent snapshot-replay, now also fails closed** (contract parity). *(S-P2-2; phase-9 `outbound-store-retention-review.md` §P2-2; `memory_store.hpp` `retrieve()`/`reset()`; `tests/session/test_memory_store_reset_during_retrieve.cpp`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-008-1 — The FileStore in-RAM offset index is uncapped and re-materialized at restart.** A per-record in-RAM index (≈ 24 B per retained outbound frame) with no cap/spill/eviction, rebuilt in full from a log scan at restart (≈ 24 B/entry ⇒ a week-long 1k msg/s session ≈ 14 GB index). Unlike QuickFIX/J's `FileStoreMaxCachedMsgs`, this index is mandatory and unbounded. **Status: deferred** (REMAINING-WORK). *(Fable `5.4`; `src/session/file_store.cpp`'s `IndexEntry`, its index members, and restart rebuild.)*
- **L-008-2 — A bounded *volatile* `MemoryStore` past capacity keeps transmitting but stops retaining (silent resend loss).** When the per-direction cap is hit, `store()` returns `store_capacity_exhausted` and `store_then_emit` is logged-then-proceed (I-07): messages keep going on the wire but are no longer retained, so a later peer `ResendRequest` folds them into a SequenceReset-GapFill — the peer's application-level recovery silently loses them (FIX-legal). **Scope narrowed by 059:** this applies ONLY to a **volatile** store (`store_is_persistent_ == false`). On a **persistent** store (`FileStore`) a genuine retain failure now **fails closed** — the session disconnects before transmitting the un-retained frame and reconciles the outbound counter to the durable value, so no silent resend loss occurs on the durable path (see `B-059-1` below / spec 059). **Status: wontfix (volatile leg).** *(Fable `5.4`; `include/fixpp/session/memory_store.hpp`'s `store_capacity_exhausted` return; the volatile logged-then-proceed arm is the `store_is_persistent_`-gated fall-through in `Session::store_then_emit`, `src/session/session.cpp` (fatal branch is persistent-only).)*
- **B-059-1 — A persistent (`FileStore`) outbound-retain failure fails closed (disconnect-and-recover), symmetric with the durable counter-write path.** On `!store_r && store_is_persistent_` with error = any persistent store-retain-fatal code except `store_cancelled` (durability-classified); `store_io_failure`/`store_seqnum_out_of_order`/`store_capacity_exhausted` are the FileStore-reachable subset, not a closed set. A custom persistent store returning any other store-block code (`store_seqnum_gap`/`store_seqnum_overflow`/`store_visitor_aborted`/`store_seqnum_invalid`/`store_invalid_range`) also fails closed. `store_then_emit` captures the error, best-effort reconciles the outbound wire counter down to the durable value (`set_next_outbound(durable_k)`; does NOT touch `hydrated_`), and returns the error **before** transmitting — the caller (`Session::send` and the broad-guard emit sites) transitions to `Disconnected` (caller-owned, transport-failure parity). Cancellation-class `store_cancelled` is excluded (absorb→proceed, FR-005). **Status: shipped (059).** *(spec 059 FR-001..007; `Session::store_then_emit` in `src/session/session.cpp`; `contracts/store-then-emit-disposition.md`.)*
  - **US3 reconnect bound:** after the fail-closed + reconcile, an in-process reconnect under `reset_seqnum_policy = bilateral_strict` (the DEFAULT) re-emits a Logon carrying `34=k (k>1)` + `141=Y` — the **pre-existing, deferred `L-029-3`** malformed-Logon shape (see below). 059 neither introduces nor fixes L-029-3; it only creates a reconnect path that can reach it. Plain-persistent sessions resume cleanly at `k`; `reset_on_logon` overrides to `34=1`. (Cross-ref only — do NOT fix L-029-3 here.)
  - **Residual window (gate-b/r1 FQ-4a):** at a best-effort-emit (swallow) call site whose continuation stays `Active`, if the reconcile read itself ALSO fails, the wire counter can remain transiently past the durable value while the session stays `Active` — the next propagating emit fail-closes and reconciles it. Custom-persistent-store-only, compound, and unreachable with `FileStore` (its `next_seqnum(outbound, false)` serves the in-memory mirror).
  - **Shutdown-race window (gate-b/r1 FQ-4b):** `store_cancelled` is excluded from the fail-closed gate (D7), so a store that returns `store_cancelled` while operational transmits but does not retain — confined to the shutdown drain race.
  - **gate-b/r1 FQ-1 scope note:** `is_persistent_retain_fatal`'s `[56,65)` range also newly catches `assign_outbound()`'s reuse of `store_seqnum_overflow` (in `src/session/session.cpp`, an in-memory counter overflow, not itself a store-retain failure) surfacing through `Session::send` — bringing it in line with the session-fatal-on-overflow disposition already enforced on other call paths regardless of store persistence.
- **L-008-3 — `FileStore` is unsupported on network/cluster filesystems, and `make()` does not detect or warn.** Cross-host correctness depends on effective advisory-lock semantics; NFS (no lock manager), SMB/CIFS, FUSE, and cluster FSes (GPFS/Lustre/GFS2/OCFS2) are outside the v1.0 contract — operators on shared storage must verify lock semantics out of band. **Status: deferred.** *(FR-013; spec §Edge Cases.)*
- **L-008-4 — `FileStore` does not encrypt persisted bytes; at-rest encryption is the OS's responsibility** (LUKS/dm-crypt, BitLocker). **Status: wontfix.** *(spec §Assumptions.)*
- **L-008-5 — Replicable / cross-process / cloud `MessageStore` is out of v1.0 scope.** **Status: deferred.** *(spec §Assumptions.)*
- **L-008-6 — Store-layer observability (structured logs / OTel spans on `store_io_failure`, flush stalls) is not shipped by 008; it routes through the 2k Logger/Tracer module.** **Status: follow-up.** *(spec §Observability.)*

## TLS policy core (011-tls-policy)

### Behaviors

- **B-011-1 — There is NO implicit default `SecurityProfile`; the `unset` sentinel is rejected at construction.** A `SecurityProfile` enum value MUST be chosen explicitly (`mtls_ca`, `mtls_pinned`, or the deprecated `one_way_ca`); the `unset = 0` sentinel is refused by `make_ssl_ctx_config` with `error::tls_invalid_security_profile` and by `Session::open` with `error::invalid_session_config`. A session can never silently open in some "default" trust posture. *(FR-013; spec §"Security profile".)*

- **B-011-2 — `one_way_ca` is `[[deprecated]]` on the enumerator itself.** The `[[deprecated]]` attribute is applied to the `one_way_ca` declaration (not merely a comment), so selecting it raises a compiler warning at every call site — a deliberate nudge toward an mTLS profile. *(FR-013; `[const §XII.5]`.)*

- **B-011-3 — Leaf-cert pinning (`mtls_pinned`) is a fixpp-original; no reference engine has it.** SHA-256-of-leaf-DER pinning with FIXS-RC1 §5 add-then-remove rotation is new to operators migrating from QuickFIX-cpp / QuickFIX/J / Fix8 — the reference-engine sweep found NONE of them implement leaf-cert pinning. Pin rotation is the ONLY mid-session-mutable TLS surface; every other TLS knob (SecurityProfile, cert_source) freezes at session open. *(Clarifications 2026-05-23; FR-006/FR-009/FR-015/FR-016.)*

- **B-011-4 — `verify_peer` enforces DoS caps with distinct named variants, not a "TLS failed" catch-all.** Peer certs are rejected at entry for oversized DER (`tls_cert_der_too_large`, default 16 KiB — refused BEFORE parsing), oversized RSA key (`tls_rsa_key_too_large`, default cap 8192 bits — `BN_mod_exp` cost is super-linear), or too many SAN entries (`tls_san_entries_exceeded`, default 64). These caps have no QuickFIX/QuickFIX-J/Fix8 analogue. Every distinct failure mode surfaces as its own `error::tls_*` variant. *(FR-019; SC-002/SC-006; spec Edge Cases.)*

- **B-011-5 — `verify_peer` short-circuits on the FIRST violation in a fixed 10-step order; cert expiry checks the effective clock, not wall-clock.** A multi-violation cert yields exactly ONE error variant per failed handshake (no aggregate report), evaluated DER-size → RSA-low → RSA-high → ECDSA-curve → chain-depth → SAN-count → X.509-version → expiration → pinning → cipher. Expiration is evaluated against the 007 effective-clock plugin, so a test/replay clock changes which certs are considered expired. *(FR-020/FR-020a; spec §Assumptions "verify_peer multi-violation ordering".)*

- **B-011-6 — An empty-but-non-null pinset under `mtls_pinned` fails EARLY at session-open, not per-handshake.** `make_ssl_ctx_config(mtls_pinned, empty_pinset, …)` returns `unexpected{tls_pin_empty_at_open}` and the session never opens — a distinct variant from `tls_pin_mismatch` so operator logs separate "fixpp-config problem" from "peer-cert problem". *(US3 scenario 5; Clarifications 2026-05-23; FR-025.)*

### Limitations

- **L-011-1 — No mid-session swap of `SecurityProfile` or `cert_source`; the supported pattern is close + reopen.** Both freeze at session open; there is deliberately no swap API. Only the `Pinset` is mid-session-mutable. **Status: wontfix.** *(FR-015/FR-016; spec Edge Cases "Operator attempts mid-session SecurityProfile swap".)*

- **L-011-2 — `add()` to a full pinset (default `max_pins = 16`) is refused — no silent eviction.** The cap is enforced; the operator must explicitly `remove()` an old pin before adding past the cap. The engine never decides which pin to drop. **Status: wontfix.** *(FR-010; US1 scenario 4.)*

- **L-011-3 — No PSK, no CRL/OCSP revocation, no mid-handshake pinset rotation, no dlopen plugin loading in v1.0.** PSK auth (T-012) and CRL/OCSP revocation infrastructure are post-v1; a pinset rotation landing mid-handshake never affects that handshake (picked up only at the next one). HSM/TPM/KMS/vault `cert_source` impls are user-side, not shipped. **Status: deferred.** *(FR-027; spec §Assumptions "Non-goals".)*

- **L-011-4 — Partial-read/torn-handshake DoS caps bound allocation, but a peer can still force the full 10-step validation cost per attempt.** The caps bound worst-case allocation/parse, but verification is run on every connecting peer; rate/connection limiting above the Transport is the operator's responsibility (acceptor saturation is out of scope per 012). **Status: deferred.** *(FR-019; cross-ref 012 spec Edge Cases "Service-side acceptor saturation".)*

---

## 2h transport — TCP / TLS / Listener / Mock (012-2h-transport)

### Behaviors

- **B-012-1 — `TCP_NODELAY` defaults to `true` (Nagle OFF), deliberately diverging from QuickFIX-cpp.** `Transport::Config::tcp_nodelay` defaults `true` and `so_linger_enabled` defaults `false`. This matches QuickFIX/J and Fix8 but diverges from QuickFIX-cpp's Nagle-ON default — the historical anomaly that production QFC configs near-universally override, because Nagle's 40 ms delay interacts badly with FIX heartbeats and single-tag updates. *(FR-029; Clarifications 2026-05-27 Q5.)*

- **B-012-2 — Reconnect mints a FRESH `Transport` per attempt; the dead instance is destroyed first.** The FSM never reuses a `Transport` across reconnect attempts — it destroys the dead one, then mints a new instance via the same `TransportFactory`. This matches the 20-year QuickFIX-cpp / QuickFIX/J / Fix8 convergent pattern. The factory (and its cached `SSL_CTX`) is long-lived; the Transport instances it produces are short-lived. *(FR-022/FR-028; Clarifications 2026-05-27 Q1; US2.)*

- **B-012-3 — `ReconnectPolicy::defaults()` is exponential-with-jitter; `defaults_quickfix_compat()` is the industry-canonical opt-out.** The default schedule is `[100 ms … 30 s]` (10 entries) with ±10 % jitter and `max_attempts = 10` (cumulative 73–89 s envelope) — a thundering-herd defense with no reference-engine analogue. Operators wanting classic behaviour call `defaults_quickfix_compat()` → single fixed 30 s interval, no jitter, no cap. Unbounded reconnect requires explicit `max_attempts = 0` (no implicit default). *(FR-019/FR-020; Clarifications 2026-05-27 Q2; SC of US2.)*

- **B-012-4 — `Listener::cancel()` stops new accepts but leaves already-handed-off Transports ALIVE.** Cancel does exactly three things: close the listening socket, complete any not-yet-resumed `async_accept` with `transport_accept_cancelled`, and leave already-produced `unique_ptr<Transport>` results untouched (ownership has passed; the listener has no handle). This diverges from QuickFIX/J's `stopAcceptingConnections()` which also kills managed sessions — that kill lives at the session layer, which is a separate concern in fixpp. Consumers needing "close everything I produced" MUST track their own Transports. *(FR-025; Clarifications 2026-05-27 Q4.)*

- **B-012-5 — A truncated TLS close (peer omits close-notify) surfaces as the DISTINCT `transport_read_truncated`, not `transport_read_eof`, and is NOT a hard error.** `close()` waits up to `tls_close_timeout` (1 s default) for the peer's close-notify; on timeout it completes with `transport_read_truncated` (mapped to a `warn`-level log by the 2k layer), preserving SC-006's distinct-named-variant rule rather than collapsing to EOF. *(FR-006; spec Edge Cases "TLS bidirectional close-notify hangs".)*

- **B-012-6 — In-flight exclusivity is an explicit API-level contract, not just strand defence.** A second concurrent `async_read_some` / `async_write` on the same Transport returns `transport_read_in_progress` / `transport_write_in_progress` immediately; for `async_connect`/`async_handshake` the answer is by ENTRY STATE, not call count — see B-339-1's per-transport tables below; "second call → `transport_already_connected`" is false for the states that ATTEMPT and for every closed state. Strand serialisation is defence-in-depth only. *(FR-007; spec Edge Cases.)*

### Limitations

- **L-012-1 — A cancelled `async_write` is NOT rolled back; a torn write/read drives session disconnect + recovery.** The contract is "durable then transmit; cancel only cancels transmit" — the persisted frame stays persisted, and the FSM treats a short write or partial read under cancellation as a torn I/O and recovers via ResendRequest. Bytes lost up to the cancellation point on a partial read are gone per ASIO's contract. **Status: wontfix.** *(FR-030; spec Edge Cases "Short write under cancellation" / "Partial read under cancellation".)*

- **L-012-2 — Acceptor saturation beyond 10²–10³ sessions/port is unbenched; a client arriving at a full backlog is not connected — whether it is refused or simply left pending is OS- and configuration-dependent.** v1.0 target deployments are 10²–10³ sessions per acceptor. `Endpoint::backlog` *is* forwarded to `listen()` — witnessed directly at 64 and at the shipped default 128 by `test_listener_acceptor.cpp` cell 11 (`RequestedListenDepthTracksConfiguredBacklogAtAc3AndDefaultDepths`, fixpp's own record of what it asked the OS for) and cell 12 (`KernelRegisteredBacklogTracksConfiguredDepthUpToSomaxconn`, Linux-only, `NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG` read-back of what the OS actually registered, clamped above `somaxconn`). Cell 12 is the only one of the two that catches a clamp applied AT the `listen()` call site while leaving cell 11's recorded expression intact; on non-Linux platforms that call-site seam is not witnessed by any cell. That a saturated queue bounds completions and that bound tracks the configured depth is witnessed by cell 10, at the depths it probes (1, 8) — below this row's 10²–10³ target range. What is not witnessed: whether the OS applies the *same* saturation mechanism at those higher depths as at the depths cell 10 probes.

  ⚠️ **fixpp makes no guarantee about how the OS declines the overflow client.** Until 2026-09-01 this row said backlog overflow "yields OS-level RST" / "returns TCP RST / connection-refused per OS behaviour". That is **false as a guarantee** and is deleted rather than re-scoped: the overflow client may be reset, refused, or left pending, per OS and per configuration (on Linux, `net.ipv4.tcp_abort_on_overflow` selects between reset and drop).

  **Operator consequence:** a client arriving while the acceptor is saturated **may** block until *its own* connect timeout expires rather than failing fast, so failover logic driven by connect *errors* cannot be relied upon to trigger. Clients that need prompt rejection must impose their own connect deadline; fixpp exposes no server-side knob that converts this into an RST. **Status: benchmark deferred; the RST claim is corrected and the backlog-forwarding behaviour is witnessed (2026-09-01).** *(FR-024; spec Edge Cases "Service-side acceptor saturation" / US3 scenario 3; issue #332.)*

- **L-012-3 — PSK is rejected at runtime (`transport_psk_unsupported`); no SHM/DPDK/Onload/UDP/Schannel/non-OpenSSL transport in v1.0.** The `TlsTransport` sub-interface reserves 4 of 5 pure-virtual slots for a future PSK hook without a major-version bump, but the v1.0 default impl rejects PSK config. Kernel-bypass transports and non-OpenSSL TLS backends are post-v1. **Status: deferred.** *(FR-017/FR-042; spec Edge Cases "Operator wires PSK config".)*

- **L-012-4 — No transport-internal write queue; outbound is depth-1, block-mode only (drop-oldest banned on message paths).** Outbound writes serialise on the session strand by construction; the strand IS the queue. There is no buffering and no drop-oldest fallback for app/session frames. **Status: wontfix.** *(FR-039; FR-042.)*

- **L-012-5 — IPv6 zone-id host strings are admitted but the full conformance corpus is deferred.** `fe80::1%eth0`-style hosts resolve via `asio::ip::resolver`, but exhaustive zone-id conformance testing is post-v1. **Status: deferred.** *(FR-018; spec Edge Cases "IPv6 zone-id host strings".)*

## Session reconnect FSM + recovery + CompID↔TLS binding (013-session-reconnect-binding)

### Behaviors

- **B-013-1 — A sequence-number gap on re-Logon now triggers recovery (ResendRequest) instead of fatal disconnect — amends 005 FR-008.** When inbound `MsgSeqNum > next_expected_inbound`, the FSM issues ResendRequest(2) and enters a transient `AwaitingResend` sub-state rather than Logging out. The too-LOW rule is unchanged: `MsgSeqNum < next_expected_inbound` with `PossDupFlag(43)≠Y` still Logs out with `session_seqnum_too_low`. This is the single biggest v1.0-GA recovery behaviour. *(FR-009; amends 005 FR-008; US1.)*

- **B-013-2 — CompID↔TLS-identity binding is enforced at Logon; this has NO reference-engine precedent.** The `peer_identity` from the TLS handshake is bound to the asserted CompID via an operator-supplied `CompIdAuthorizationPolicy`; a mismatch rejects Logon with `session_compid_unauthorized`. No QuickFIX-cpp / QuickFIX/J / Fix8 engine binds the cert to the application-layer CompID — without this, mTLS authenticates the cert but anything can assert any CompID. *(FR-019/FR-021; FIXS §4.4; US2.)*

- **B-013-3 — `CompIdAuthorizationPolicy` is allow-list only and default-deny: an empty policy rejects EVERY Logon.** The operator MUST enumerate every `{principal → compid_set}` binding before opening a session; a misconfigured deploy fails CLOSED, never open. There is no deny-list / hybrid mode. The empty-policy rejection is per-Logon at runtime (fail-closed), not at config-build time (not fail-fast). *(FR-023; Clarifications 2026-05-28 Q3; US2 scenario 6.)*

- **B-013-4 — Principal extraction is a fixed CN → SAN-DNS → SAN-URI → SHA-256-fingerprint order with EXACT byte matching.** First-non-empty wins; the order is invariant and not operator-overridable in v1.0. Matching is exact byte comparison — no case-folding, no NFC/IDNA normalization, no URI normalization, no trimming. A no-client-cert / `one_way_ca` peer falls through to the all-zero 64-char hex fingerprint principal, which fails closed unless the operator deliberately bound it. *(FR-019/FR-022; Clarifications 2026-05-28 Q2.)*

- **B-013-5 — In-process credential rotation: `reload_credentials()` swaps the cert without tearing down active sessions.** An atomic swap on the factory-internal `cert_source_slot_` means active sessions stay Active and only the NEXT reconnect handshake observes the new cert. A rotation racing an in-flight handshake DEFERS: the in-flight handshake completes on the OLD source (captured by shared_ptr value-copy), avoiding mid-handshake `SSL_CTX` mutation (OpenSSL UB). No reference engine supports in-process cert rotation — all three require a full restart. *(FR-030/FR-031/FR-033; Clarifications 2026-05-28 Q4; US4.)*

- **B-013-6 — `ResetSeqNumFlag(141)=Y` handling is operator-selectable; the default `bilateral_strict` diverges by being security-default.** Three modes: `bilateral_strict` (default — Logout with `session_seqnum_reset_mismatch` if the peer's response lacks 141=Y), `bilateral_lenient` (auto-mirror), `unilateral` (honour unconditionally). Default is bilateral_strict per the no-implicit-default principle and 2-of-3 industry convergence (QFC mirror, QFJ strict, Fix8 unilateral). Logout disconnect timeout defaults to 2000 ms, matching QuickFIX/J and diverging from QFC/Fix8's effectively-immediate close. *(FR-017/FR-008; Clarifications 2026-05-28 Q1/Q5.)*

### Limitations

- **L-013-1 — The `AwaitingResend` recovery sub-state is NOT surfaced as a SessionEvent; observe it via the `is_awaiting_resend()` accessor.** Entry/exit of AwaitingResend emit no `SessionEvent` variant (deferred as YAGNI for v1.0) — the FSM stays in Active with a transient flag. Operator tooling polls `ReconnectFsm::is_awaiting_resend()`. **Status: wontfix.** *(FR-009 / CHK041; spec §"Recovery sub-protocol".)*

- **L-013-2 — The inbound-held-message queue during recovery is UNBOUNDED; overflow is undefined for v1.0.** Inbound messages above `next_expected_inbound` are held in-memory in `ResendState::inbound_held` with no capacity ceiling; the window is bounded only by the `ReconnectPolicy` envelope and typical venue replay limits, not by a hard cap. **Status: deferred.** *(FR-009 / CHK003; spec §"Recovery sub-protocol".)*

- **L-013-3 — `tls_validation_failed` sub_reason strings are NOT ABI-stable; use the master-enum `code` for programmatic dispatch.** Of the 6 master-enum variants, `tls_handshake_failed` is a GROUPING variant collapsing 10+ rejection reasons surfaced only via the human-readable `sub_reason` string. Consumers MUST switch on `code` first and tolerate unknown sub_reason strings by logging verbatim (treating an unknown one as fatal is forbidden). **Status: wontfix.** *(FR-026/FR-027 / CHK010/CHK030; spec §"TLS validation outcome → SessionEvent".)*

- **L-013-4 — Deny-list / hybrid authorization modes, and per-binding principal-extraction overrides, are deferred to a later feature.** v1.0 ships allow-list-only with a fixed extraction order; adding modes/overrides is backward-compatible (one-way restriction). **Status: deferred.** *(FR-022/FR-023.)*

- **L-013-5 — No fixpp-managed zeroisation of `cert_source` private-key material; it lives for the shared_ptr lifetime.** A captured `std::shared_ptr<cert_source>` keeps PEM key bytes alive until the last strong-ref drops; fixpp performs no explicit zeroisation in v1.0. Operators with strict requirements must implement a `cert_source` whose destructor overwrites its buffer. **Status: deferred.** *(FR-033 / CHK032; spec §"2j ReloadCertSource control-plane".)*

- **L-013-6 — The `SessionEvent` ring is fixed at 16 entries, drop-oldest, and snapshots are single-thread-context only.** Capacity is compile-time fixed (not operator-tunable in v1.0); the 17th emit overwrites entry 0; the `recent_events()` span is a snapshot invalidated by the next strand emit, so consumers that outlive the synchronous context MUST copy. **Status: wontfix.** *(FR-035 / CHK002/CHK003.)*

---

## Live transport wiring — reconnect / identity / rotation events (014-transport-active-binding)

### Behaviors

- **B-014-1 — An authorization failure on the live RECONNECT path is reason-agnostic retry-to-cap, NOT terminal disconnect.** Unlike 013's open-Logon path (where an authorize failure drives terminal `Disconnected`), a reconnect-path failure of ANY cause — `make()` failure, connect, TLS handshake, OR off-list/absent-identity authorization — consumes exactly one attempt and retries per the backoff schedule. Only loop-exhaustion at the cap is terminal. There is no fail-fast and no distinct cap for the authorization case. *(FR-003/FR-007; Clarifications 2026-05-29; contract C1/C2.)*

- **B-014-2 — On the live initiator reconnect path, authorization uses the REAL handshake identity — no fabricated stand-in.** 014 swaps the identity source (013's test-seam/stub → real `handshake_result.peer_id`), making the already-fail-CLOSED mTLS gate operable: it now ADMITS an on-list peer instead of unconditionally fail-closing for want of any identity. This does not introduce fail-closed from scratch and opens no fail-OPEN hole. *(FR-006; SC-003; contract C2.)*

- **B-014-3 — `credentials_rotated` carries REAL leaf fingerprints; the first-ever credential load is NOT a rotation.** The event (emitted on the session strand at the next `drive_reconnect_attempt`, before `make()`) carries the real SHA-256 leaf fingerprints of old and new `cert_source`, replacing 013's all-zero stub. The first-ever load (`last_active_source_ == nullptr`) emits NO event — it just sets the rotation baseline. A no-op rotation (`old == new`) still emits (not suppressed). *(FR-009/FR-010/FR-011; contract C3.)*

- **B-014-4 — A non-TLS or null transport from the factory is runtime-recoverable, not a crash.** The FSM reaches the TLS specialization via a single `dynamic_cast<TlsTransport*>` with a null-check; because `TlsTransport` inherits virtually from `Transport`, a `make()` returning a base/non-TLS transport yields `nullptr` → the attempt is counted and the loop continues. *(FR-001; contract C1.)*

### Limitations

- **L-014-1 — Acceptor sessions do NOT drive a reconnect loop; reconnect is initiator-side only.** Acceptors re-accept rather than reconnecting (a permanent FIX design fact). **Status: wontfix** for the reconnect asymmetry; the live acceptor accept→handshake→`authorize()` production path itself shipped in 015 (it was 014's deferred boundary, not 014). *(spec §Assumptions "Reconnect is initiator-side"; Out of Scope.)*

- **L-014-4 — `error::session_seqnum_too_high` (slot 120) replaces the vestigial slot-74 stand-in; the retired slot remains a permanent numeric hole.** The seqnum manager's too-high branch now returns a dedicated, semantically-correct code instead of reusing slot 74 (`session_test_request_unanswered`); error slots are append-only and retired slots are never reused. **Status: follow-up.** *(FR-016; contract — error-enum append `error::session_seqnum_too_high = 120`.)*

---

## Runtime engine (015-runtime-engine)

### Behaviors

- **B-015-1 — Initiator emits its Logon AFTER connect (connect-then-Logon).**
  An engine-managed initiator does **not** emit the initial Logon at `open()`; the Logon
  is sent only once the transport is live (post-connect, post-handshake), over the
  rebound outbound sink. This matches QuickFIX-cpp (`setResponder()` → `generateLogon()`)
  and Fix8 (`connect()` → `send(generate_logon())`); fixpp's pre-015 per-session-direct
  model (emit-at-open) was the outlier. *(FR-003; data-model E-1a; gated by
  `SessionConfig::engine_managed`, default `false` so non-engine sessions are unchanged.)*

- **B-015-2 — `Engine::stop()` closes live transport sockets, and is mandatory before
  destruction.** `stop()` emits total-cancellation **and** closes each session's live
  transport socket, because total-cancel alone does **not** break a blocked idle
  `async_read_some` on an established TLS session (no peer EOF). `~Engine()` is a strict
  `assert(stopped())` — you **must** `co_await stop()` before destroying an `Engine`,
  **even if it was never started**. *(FR-011; data-model E-7; T018; see
  `[[feedback_engine_stop_must_close_transports_total_cancel_insufficient]]`.)*

- **B-015-3 — `lookup()` returns null for a registered-but-not-yet-open session.**
  Sessions are constructed **lazily** inside their accept/connect loop, not at
  `register_session` or `start()`. So immediately after `start()`, and for an acceptor
  with no peer yet, `lookup(id)` legitimately returns `nullptr` — null is not an error.
  *(data-model E-7 "open() sequencing"; Gate A New-3.)*

- **B-015-4 — Acceptors resolve sessions by reversed CompID against a static registry.**
  An inbound Logon is matched by reversing its `SenderCompID(49)`/`TargetCompID(56)`
  against the registered `SessionId`s (mirrors QuickFIX `lookupSession(..., true)` /
  QuickFIX/J `getReverseSessionID()`). No dynamic session provider. *(FR-005/006;
  data-model E-2; R2/R4.)*

### Limitations

- **L-015-1 — One connect+pump per initiator; multi-cycle reconnect-respin is not
  implemented.** The engine drives a single connect → handshake → Logon → read-pump per
  initiator session. `Session::close(close_mode::terminal)` is permanent
  (`lifecycle::closed_drained`), so the same `Session` cannot reconnect; a transport drop
  on an established session is session-fatal (→ `Disconnected`), not auto-respun.
  **Status: deferred** (needs fresh-Session-per-reconnect or a lifecycle re-open redesign
  — its own future feature). *(data-model E-1a; Clarifications 2026-05-31.)*

- **L-015-3 — Bounded below the Phase-5 service wrapper (scope).** No config-file
  parsing, no `Application` user-callback ecosystem, no store/log factory abstractions,
  no C-ABI / control-plane / observability / pybind, and no user sink for inbound
  *application* messages (the read-pump delivers every frame to the admin/session layer).
  **Status: wontfix for 015** (intentional scope bound). *(FR-013; spec "Scope guard".)*

- **L-015-4 — A `Session` must outlive all work dispatched on its executor (lifetime
  contract; not enforced at `~Session`).** `Session::dispatch_app_callback` posts a
  handler that captures `this`, and in debug/sanitizer builds the re-entrancy
  `dispatch_guard` dtor stores to `in_dispatch_` *after* the user callback returns.
  Destroying the `Session` while a dispatched callback is queued/running (incl. that
  trailing store) is a use-after-scope / data race. **Production is safe today:**
  `dispatch_app_callback` has no production callers (the `Application` app-callback path is
  Phase-5, L-015-3), and the Engine drains every session on teardown (`stop()` →
  `close(terminal)` + join-before-registry-clear; `~Engine()` asserts `stop()`). The hazard
  is only reachable by **bypassing the Engine** — constructing a raw `Session`, dispatching
  on it, and destroying it without draining `exec_` (the seam tests; fixed in
  `test_executor_compat.cpp run_combo` by a guard-less post onto `executor()` + wait).
  Unlike `~Engine()`, `~Session()` does **not** assert a drained precondition. **Status:
  follow-up — Phase-5 app-callback wiring MUST drain dispatched app work on session
  teardown** (a shared keepalive, cf. the 014 detached-write fix), and should consider a
  debug `~Session` guard once the precise "no in-flight executor work" invariant is
  trackable. *(`include/fixpp/session/session.hpp dispatch_app_callback`; CI-TSan, 2026-06-01.)*

## Interop harness (016-interop-harness)

### Behaviors

- **B-016-1 — The thorny corpus reconciles to the FIX spec, not to a reference
  engine; a fixpp-vs-engine divergence is encoded against the spec mandate (FR-018).**
  Where a reference engine special-cases behavior fixpp does not, the corpus encodes
  fixpp's actual spec-defensible behavior and documents the divergence (disposition
  `pass`, not a known-limitation). Worked example: an inbound **Logout carrying a
  too-high MsgSeqNum** does **not** disconnect on fixpp (as QuickFIX-J#750 chose) —
  fixpp's uniform FIX-SL §4.5.3 gap-recovery takes precedence (ResendRequest, stays
  Active), recovering the gap before the Logout is dispatched; only a too-low Logout
  disconnects. *(`tests/interop/thorny/recovery/qfj-750-logout-seqnum-mismatch_test.cpp`;
  `tests/interop/thorny/CORPUS-INDEX.md` C-004; FR-018.)*

### Limitations

- **L-016-2 — Live interop is all-TLS with a server-auth `one_way_ca` baseline;
  mutual-certificate mTLS is deferred to v1.1.** fixpp ships TLS-only (no plaintext
  transport) *for live interop cells*, so every live cell runs over TLS; the v1.0 baseline trusts a
  counterparty server cert (`one_way_ca`). App-layer client-cert ↔ CompID mutual mTLS
  (`mtls_ca`) is `deferred:v1.1-mtls`. **Status: wontfix for v1.0** (intentional scope
  bound). *(FR-025; `tests/interop/happy/MATRIX.md`.)*
  **NOTE (2026-06-17, 043):** The general claim "fixpp ships TLS-only" no longer holds — 043 added
  `asio_plain_transport` behind the loud `insecure_plain_tcp` opt-in. The live-interop MATRIX still
  runs all-TLS (no plaintext interop cells planned); this limitation's scope is the 016 interop matrix.

### Behaviors

- **B-017-1 — `overflow_policy::drop_newest` preserves the oldest in-flight record.**
  When the MPSC ring is full, the producer detects the full ring and drops the record it
  is *about to enqueue* (newest = just-arriving), not an older in-flight slot. This means
  the oldest records are always preserved with an exact `drop_count()`. The stale-read
  of `read_sequence_` under `relaxed` ordering can only cause an *early* drop — safe for
  `drop_newest`. *(FR-003/FR-004; data-model §overflow_policy; TS-2.)*

- **B-017-2 — `block` overflow mode is prohibited from session-strand coroutines.**
  `overflow_policy::block` makes the producer spin-yield until a ring slot is available.
  This pins the executor OS thread at the enqueue site, which is equivalent to holding
  `std::mutex` inside a coroutine — explicitly prohibited by `[const §XI.3]`. A debug
  `FIXPP_ASSERT` fires if `block` is used from a detected session-executor thread.
  `block` is safe only from dedicated non-coroutine producer threads (e.g. background
  control-plane threads not sharing the session executor). *(FR-004; contracts/log-core.md;
  data-model §overflow_policy.)*

### Limitations

- **L-017-1 — The three log macros (`FIXPP_SLOG`/`FIXPP_ELOG`/`FIXPP_LOG0`) take an
  explicit `logger_ptr` first argument — a deliberate deviation from FR-013's no-logger
  signature.** FR-013 specifies the three context-tier macros with no explicit logger
  parameter; the implementation instead requires an explicit `Logger*` first arg because
  loggers are per-engine (there is no global logger per `[const §XIII.1]`), and a
  no-arg form would require a `thread_local` or implicit injection mechanism that violates
  `[const §XIII.3]`. The explicit-logger form is the public API for v1.0; operators must
  hold and pass the logger pointer from their engine/session context.
  **Status: wontfix for v1.0** (deliberate; `thread_local` banned). *(FR-013; [const §XIII.3];
  data-model §Trace-correlation-macros.)*

- **L-017-2 — The MPSC ring advances `read_sequence_` AFTER the drain copies the record
  out of the slot, not before.** This means a slot is held for the full duration of the
  drain's `Sink::emit()` fan-out, costing at most 1 of 65,536 slots per in-flight drain
  iteration. The record is fully copied before the slot is released, so there is no
  use-after-free risk. The alternative (Disruptor copy-then-free) advances the sequence
  before fan-out; our variant is simpler and the 1/65,536 overhead is negligible.
  **Status: wontfix** (defensible design choice; single-consumer ring). *(logger.cpp drain

  vs quill 11.x at 50% fill on reference CI hardware) is deferred — it is a **recorded,
  non-blocking metric** that does NOT gate v1.0 delivery. The backend is swappable behind
  the identical `Logger` facade without any public-API change.

  Constructing `SessionSpans` in the real session-FSM open path and emitting spans from

- **L-017-6 — `overflow_policy::drop_newest` is the only supported overflow mode for
  session-strand producers; `block` mode is prohibited from coroutine contexts.** The
  `block` policy spins until a ring slot opens, which pins the executor thread. This
  violates `[const §XI.3]` (no mutex/spin in coroutine context) and is equivalent to
  holding a `std::mutex` inside a `co_await` chain. A debug `FIXPP_ASSERT` fires if
  `block` is used from a detected session-executor thread. Operators who need guaranteed
  delivery (no drops) from a non-coroutine thread may use `block` on a dedicated
  non-session OS thread.

- **L-017-8 — The `overflow_policy::block` session-strand debug guard is not implemented
  (T033/T034 deferral).** `contracts/log-core.md` and `logger.hpp` specify that a debug
  `FIXPP_ASSERT` fires if `block` is used from a session-executor thread. This guard is
  **not yet implemented** because `Logger` is intentionally session/engine-ref-free
  (`[2k §4.3]`): it holds no session executor reference, so there is no cheap hook to
  detect "am I on a session-executor thread". The raw-thread path (the only production
  use today) is correct. Session-strand misuse of `block` is a documented **caller
  obligation**, not a runtime-enforced invariant in v1.0. T033/T034 track a follow-up
  approach (e.g. a `LoggerConfig` flag or an injected `is_session_thread` predicate from
  the caller) that keeps Logger ref-free while enabling the guard.
  **Status: deferred** (T033/T034). *(FR-004; `[2k §4.3]`; `src/log/logger.cpp` block
  path comment; L-017-6 is the caller-obligation counterpart.)*

- **L-017-7 — `FIXPP_SLOG` uses `system_clock::now()` (wall-clock) for its timestamp;
  deterministic mock-clock control applies only to `FIXPP_ELOG`.** FR-006's "effective
  clock" determinism is scoped to the Engine-tier macro `FIXPP_ELOG`, which reads
  `engine.clock()->now()` (the injected `EngineConfig::clock`). `FIXPP_SLOG` carries
  only the caller's `trace_context` (trace_id + span_id) — there is no clock field in
  `trace_context` because adding one would widen the SLOG call-site API (`[2k §4.3]`
  locked surface). `FIXPP_LOG0` (Tier 3, zero context) is wall-clock by design. In
  practice, wall-clock timestamps are monotone-ish for log ordering; the gap only
  matters for test determinism, not production correctness. Threading the effective
  clock into SLOG is a future extension (see T033/T034).
  **Status: deferred** (T033/T034; would require macro-signature change and a clock

### Behaviors

- **B-019-1 — Reject/veto is signalled by return value, never by an exception.** A
  `fromApp`/`fromAdmin` callback returns `unexpected(error)` to reject (→
  `BusinessMessageReject(35=j)` / session `Reject(35=3)` respectively); a `toApp` callback
  returns `unexpected(error::app_do_not_send)` to veto an outbound app message (DoNotSend),
  or another `error` to abort the send with that error surfaced to the `Engine::send`
  caller. `toAdmin` is inspect-only (admin messages are always sent). This is a deliberate
  divergence from QuickFIX's exception-based callback API to fit the fixpp no-throw house
  style (`[const §XV.9]`). *(FR-005/007/008/015; data-model reject/veto table; research D1/D2.)*

- **B-019-2 — A throwing user callback is a fatal user-contract violation → terminal
  session close.** Because every normal outcome (accept/reject/veto) is a return value, an
  exception escaping any of the 7 callbacks is unexpected: the engine catches it at the
  dispatch boundary, clears the re-entrancy guard, terminal-closes the session, and records
  `error::app_callback_threw`. The exception never reaches engine internals. *(FR-011;
  research D5; `tests/session/test_application_throw.cpp`.)*

- **B-019-3 — `Engine::send` is any-thread-safe and posts onto the per-session strand.**
  `co_await engine.send(id, payload)` looks the session up (capturing a `shared_ptr<Session>`
  keepalive that outlives the post — the 014 detached-write UAF class), posts onto the
  session's `exec_`, runs `toApp`, then the durable-before-transmit `Session::send` path.
  The awaited result carries the veto/store/write outcome (natural backpressure — no
  silent-drop queue, `[const §XV.15]`). A re-entrant `send` from inside an on-strand
  callback is enqueued behind the current dispatch (no deadlock). *(FR-006; research D3/D6;
  `tests/session/test_application_strand.cpp`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-019-1 — Outbound interception is inspect + veto only; in-place outbound message
  MODIFICATION is deferred to a later Phase-5 slice.** `toApp` may inspect the outbound
  `MessageView` and veto it (`app_do_not_send`); `toAdmin` may inspect it. Neither can
  MODIFY/stamp the outbound message in place this slice — a mutable outbound builder/view
  is a large, separable design (it would expose the `Writer`/builder mid-emit) and is not
  required for the G2 round-trip (the originator builds the full payload passed to
  `Engine::send`). The user stamps fields by constructing the payload before `send`.
  **Status: deferred** (mutable outbound interception, a later Phase-5 slice). *(FR-007/008;
  research D1; spec.md §FR-007/008 forward-pointer; contracts/application-interface.md
  §Out of contract.)*

- **L-019-2 — A single `Application` is registered per `Engine` (no per-session override).**
  `EngineConfig::application` holds one `Application` invoked for all of the engine's
  sessions, with the `SessionId` passed per call (the QuickFIX-C++/J + Fix8 model). A
  per-session `Application` override is out of scope for this slice.
  **Status: deferred** (per-session override, a later Phase-5 slice). *(FR-002;
  Clarifications 2026-06-03 Q2; data-model §EngineConfig::application.)*

- **L-019-4 — `toApp` is an ORIGINATE-path tap; retransmissions answering a peer
  `ResendRequest` are NOT surfaced to `toApp` and cannot be app-vetoed or app-gap-filled.**
  On a `ResendRequest`, `replay_outbound_range_` (`src/session/session.cpp`) re-transmits each
  stored **application** frame verbatim via `build_replay_frame` (stamping `PossDupFlag(43)=Y`
  + `OrigSendingTime(122)` per 037) with **no `toApp` call**; absent slots and **admin** frames
  are folded into a `SequenceReset-GapFill` (which *does* fire `toAdmin`). This wire output is
  FIX-conformant — retransmitted application messages carry `43=Y`, admin/absent ranges are
  gap-filled — and is live-proven against QuickFIX-cpp and QuickFIX-J. The divergence is at the
  **callback** layer only: QuickFIX calls `toApp` for every resent message and converts an
  application `DoNotSend` into a `SequenceReset-GapFill` over that slot; fixpp offers no
  equivalent. Operator consequence: an `Application` using `toApp` as a compliance/audit tap
  will **not observe retransmissions**, and cannot elect to gap-fill a stale application message
  on resend. **Why this is a deferral, not a quick wiring:** the originate-path `toApp` veto
  means *drop the frame and consume no outbound seqnum* (L-019-1 / B-036-1) — a semantic that is
  invalid on the resend path, where the seqnum is already consumed and the peer is waiting for
  it; reusing it would punch a sequence hole and break the peer's recovery. Correct resend
  interception must re-interpret a veto as `DoNotSend → emit a GapFill over that slot`, a
  separable Phase-5 slice, not a config flag. **Status: by-design / deferred** (the wire
  behavior is conformant today; resend observability + app-driven `DoNotSend`-on-resend gap-fill
  is a future Phase-5 slice). *(scopes 019 FR-007/008 `toApp`; resend path =

## G2 Business Messages (020-g2-business-messages)

### Feature Catalogue Rows

No new catalogue rows. A-001 (NewOrderSingle 35=D) and A-006 (ExecutionReport 35=8)
**stay `backlog`** with a partial-G2-interop-evidence gap-note (NOT a closure) — see the
`## Application Messages — Order Management` blockquote in `spec/feature-catalogue.md` and
the A-001/A-006 gap-notes in `spec/coverage-index.md`. Mints `fixpp::core::error`
enumerator `app_payload_malformed = 131` (`tests/core/test_019_error_completeness.cpp`
forward-boundary now at slot 132; exact-SET ownership of 131 by the 020 completeness gate).

### Behaviors

- **B-020-1 — Application sends now place MsgType(35) at wire field-3 with a digit-only
  BodyLength.** `Session::send_impl` (the path under `Engine::send` and `Session::send`)
  re-frames the outbound application frame so the first three wire fields are
  `8=BeginString`, `9=BodyLength`, `35=MsgType` in that order, and `9=` is digit-only /
  unpadded (`.specify/2b-wire.md`). Previously MsgType landed 7th and `9=` was zero-padded
  (`9=000045`) — accepted by fixpp's lenient parser but rejected by QuickFIX/J/cpp + Fix8.
  This corrects 019's latent opaque-path framing for ALL app sends, not just the typed
  builders. *(FR-004a; research.md D1; data-model.md INV-1; B-020 send-path framing.)*

- **B-020-2 — Application send payloads are validated fail-closed before any seqnum/transmit.**
  `Engine::send` / `Session::send` copy arbitrary opaque app bytes; `send_impl` now validates
  the payload BEFORE stamping SendingTime, peeking/assigning a seqnum, or storing/transmitting:
  it must lead with exactly one `35=` MsgType field and carry no embedded session header/trailer
  tag (`8/9/34/49/52/56/10`); empty, no-leading-`35=`, duplicate-`35=`, or embedded-tag payloads
  are rejected with `error::app_payload_malformed` (131) and consume NO seqnum. Two additional
  defensive floors are enforced (gate-b/r1 RC#2): (a) the payload must **end with SOH**
  (`pv.back() == '\x01'`) so the final field is terminated before checksum append; (b) the
  MsgType value must be **non-empty** (`first_soh > 3`, i.e. at least one byte between `35=`
  and the first SOH). Both return `app_payload_malformed` with no seqnum consumed. *(FR-016;
  data-model.md INV-8; research.md D1 opaque-payload validation.)*

- **B-020-3 — Typed minimal builders for NewOrderSingle / ExecutionReport.**
  `build_new_order_single` (Limit-only, OrdType=2) and `build_execution_report` (fully-filled
  reply: ExecType='F'/OrdStatus='2'/LeavesQty=0/CumQty=OrderQty/AvgPx=Price) are `noexcept`,
  allocation-free (stack-scratch-then-copy, INV-4 atomicity), emit the app body only (no
  session header/trailer tags), and serialize numerics via `decimal_t::format` (canonical,
  locale-independent). The READ side consumes the already-generated `fixpp::v44` flyweights.
  *(FR-001..008; data-model.md E1/E2; INV-2/3/4; `[const §VIII.5]`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-020-1 — Minimal field set only; full FIX 4.4 field/group coverage is deferred.**
  The 020 builders emit only the minimal NOS/ExecRpt fields (NOS: 11/55/54/38/40/44/60;
  ExecRpt: 37/17/150/39/55/54/151/14/6). NewOrderSingle is **Limit-only** (OrdType fixed to
  `2`, Price always required); Market orders, optional fields, and repeating groups are not
  supported. The full-coverage path is the codegen *writer-emitter* (which would emit writers
  for the entire message set). **Status: deferred** (FR-015a — codegen writer-emitter).
  *(FR-015a; research.md D3/D5 + "Forward obligations"; Deferred-work registry in CLAUDE.md.)*

- **L-020-2 — FIX 4.4 only; all-protocol-version coverage (4.2 / 5.0SP2 / FIXT.1.1) is
  scheduled post-v1.0.** The typed builders + live interop cells negotiate FIX 4.4 only
  (matching 016/018 and the generated `fixpp::v44` flyweights). NewOrderSingle/ExecutionReport
  over 4.2 / 5.0SP2 / FIXT.1.1 (interop roadmap G4 axis) are not covered. **Status: deferred**
  (FR-015b — scheduled post-v1.0). *(FR-015b; research.md D8 + "Forward obligations";
  Deferred-work registry in CLAUDE.md.)*

- **L-020-3 — ExecType/OrdStatus enum values are not validated against the FIX 4.4 enum set;
  only printable, non-control ASCII (0x20–0x7E) is enforced.** The builders accept any
  printable char for `exec_type`/`ord_status` (e.g. `'Z'` succeeds). Caller-supplied chars
  are printable-floor-checked only; full FIX 4.4 enum-set validation (e.g. restricting
  `exec_type` to `'0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'B'/'C'/'D'/'E'/'F'/'G'/'H'/'I'/'J'`)
  is deferred (FR-015a). The `exec_type='F'` / `ord_status='2'` (fully-filled) contract is a
  caller/harness obligation (data-model.md E2/E3), not a builder precondition.
  **Status: deferred** (FR-015a). *(gate-b/r1 RC#4; contracts/business-messages.md §Conventions.)*

<!-- 021-inbound-possdup-origsendingtime -->

- **B-021-1 — Inbound possible-duplicate (`PossDupFlag(43)=Y`) handling is tolerant and
  wire-conformant.** A too-low inbound message (`MsgSeqNum < expected`) bearing `43=Y` and a
  valid `OrigSendingTime(122)` is TOLERATED: the session stays `Active`, the expected inbound
  seqnum is NOT advanced, and the message is not re-applied (Arm A). Independently, any `43=Y`
  non-`SequenceReset(35=4)` inbound (any seqnum, including at-expected) is VALIDATED for
  OrigSendingTime: missing `122` → session `Reject(35=3)` with `RefTagID(371)=122`,
  `SessionRejectReason(373)=1` (RequiredTagMissing), session survives (Arm C); `122` present
  but unparseable → same Arm C disposition (`Reject 371=122/373=1`, session survives —
  an unusable `122` is treated identically to an absent one); `122 > 52` strict →
  `Reject(35=3)` `371=122`, `373=10` (SendingTimeAccuracyProblem) + `Logout` +
  `Disconnected` (Arm D). At the expected seqnum each of these Rejects consumes it (B-423-1,
  fixpp#423). `122 == 52` is accepted. Validation runs AFTER the too-high arm
  (a forward-gap `43=Y` still issues `ResendRequest`, matching QuickFIX-cpp v1.16.0 +
  QuickFIX-J 3.0.1) and BEFORE the too-low/at-expected disposition. `SequenceReset(35=4)+43=Y`
  is exempt from the `122` requirement (Arm E — routed to the existing reset/gap-fill path).
  **Status: shipped** (021, updated gate-b/r1). *(FR-001..FR-007; data-model.md §1 INV-1/3/4;
  research.md D1/D4/D5/D6; engine-parity placement = user decision 2026-06-04.)*

- **B-021-2 — Guard-3 `SendingTime(52)` MaxLatency validation precedes Stage-1 possdup
  (matches QFJ `verify()` ordering).** Guard-3 (inbound SendingTime accuracy check, 120 s
  default threshold) runs BEFORE the Stage-1 possdup block. A `43=Y` replay carrying a
  stale or unparseable `SendingTime(52)` is therefore killed by Guard-3 — it emits
  `Reject(35=3, 371=52, 373=10)` + `Logout` + `Disconnect` — and never reaches Arm A.
  FR-001's "too-low `43=Y` must not disconnect" guarantee implicitly assumes a
  well-formed, recent `52` (which is the realistic retransmit case: a genuine replay
  re-stamps `52=now`, carrying only the original time in `122`). This ordering is
  byte-faithful to QFJ `Session.java` `isGoodTime`@1821 before `validatePossDup`@1843.
  **Status: shipped** (021, documented gate-b/r1). *(Guard-3 and Stage-1, both
  in `src/session/session.cpp`.)*

- **L-021-1 — App possible-duplicate disposition is configurable (default DROP); admin
  duplicates are ALWAYS ignored.** For a validated too-low possible-duplicate APPLICATION
  message, `SessionConfig::redeliver_poss_dup` (default `false`) governs disposition: `false`
  drops it (no `Application::fromApp`); `true` redelivers it to `fromApp` (the replayed frame
  carries `43=Y`, so the callback sees it flagged possible-duplicate). ADMINISTRATIVE duplicates
  are ignored unconditionally, even when the knob is `true` — this asymmetry is operator-visible.
  Neither disposition advances the seqnum or disconnects. This is a PROTOCOL duplicate-discard
  (the message was already processed once; `MsgSeqNum < expected` proves it) — NOT a
  `[const §XV.15]` backpressure/queue drop; the sequence contract is exactly preserved.
  **Status: shipped** (021, FR-010). *(data-model.md §2; research.md D2; distinguish from
  [const §XV.15].)*

- **L-021-3 — The PossDup-replay live interop cells run against QuickFIX-J only; the
  QuickFIX-cpp half is waived with rationale (SC-004 not claimed fully met).** Witnessing
  fixpp's inbound PossDup tolerance live requires the counterparty to INJECT a too-low `43=Y`
  frame on command. Only QuickFIX-J can: its public `Session.send(message, allowPosDup=true)`
  preserves `PossDupFlag(43)`/`OrigSendingTime(122)`. QuickFIX-cpp v1.16.0 cannot —
  `Session::send()` unconditionally strips `43`/`122`, `sendRaw` is private, there is no
  `AllowPosDup` setting, and a too-low replay is not a behaviour a healthy QuickFIX-cpp session
  ever produces (it resends only the gap ranges it is asked for, never an already-seen frame).
  The four `PD-QFcpp-*` cells are therefore `deferred:qfcpp-no-possdup-injection` (status `n/a`)
  in `tests/interop/cell_results.yaml`. fixpp's tolerance is a RECEIVE-path property — the
  injected bytes are identical regardless of the sending engine — so it is proven LIVE against
  QuickFIX-J 3.0.1 (the four `PD-QFj-*` cells: replay-survives + malformed-dup-rejected ×
  initiator + acceptor, green under `normal` + `asan` — the config then labelled `asan-ubsan`,
  which `run_interop_cell.py` mapped to the **ASan-only** preset, so **no UBSan ran**) and in-process by
  `test_inbound_poss_dup_tolerance.cpp` / `test_inbound_poss_dup_validation.cpp`. Consequently
  **SC-004's QuickFIX-cpp clause is waived-with-rationale, not met**; SC-001/SC-002 are
  satisfied by the QuickFIX-J live cells + the unit suite. **Status: shipped + waived**
  (2026-06-11, Item-1 live sweep). *(021 SC-001/SC-002/SC-004;

## PossResend(97) inbound + AllowPosDup send-path strip (022-possresend-allowpossdup-send)

<!-- 022-possresend-allowpossdup-send — completes catalogue row S-010 (backlog → done) -->

- **B-022-1 — A plain `send` strips caller-supplied `PossDupFlag(43)` / `OrigSendingTime(122)`
  by default; the auto-resend path always re-adds them independently.** `SessionConfig::allow_pos_dup`
  (default `false`, QuickFIX-J `AllowPosDup` config-key parity) governs the plain `Session::send`
  path: `false` (default) STRIPS any caller-supplied `43`/`122` from the opaque application payload
  before framing; `true` RETAINS their values verbatim (operator opt-in for callers that manage their own
  duplicate flags); since fixpp#422 they go out inside the standard header, not where the caller
  placed them (B-422-1). The strip is a no-heap, boundary-anchored field excision behind a 022-owned
  per-field scanner that validates every post-`35=` field is `<non-empty digit-only tag>=<value>\x01`
  (since fixpp#421 the tag must also have no leading zero and be at most 65535, B-421-1)
  and fails the send CLOSED (`app_payload_malformed=131`, no seqnum consumed, no transmit) on the
  FIRST malformed field — a missing `=`, an empty/non-digit tag, or an empty field (cases the 020
  denylist floor admits). Only complete, SOH-boundary-anchored `43=…\x01`/`122=…\x01` fields are
  excised; a literal `43=` inside another field's value (no preceding SOH) is preserved (injection-safe,
  INV-2). The automatic resend/retransmission path (`build_replay_frame`) ALWAYS re-adds `43=Y`+`122`
  regardless of the knob — it never routes through `send_impl` (FR-007, structural). Default-strip is
  an intentional default wire-behavior change matching QuickFIX-cpp (unconditional strip) and
  QuickFIX-J (default strip). **Status: shipped** (022, supersedes L-021-2). *(FR-006..FR-009;
  data-model.md §2 INV-1..5; research.md D1/D2/D5/D6; contracts §C2/§C3; one site in `send_impl`.)*

- **L-022-1 — `PossResend(97)` carries NO session-level handling; it is delivered to the
  application for business-level duplicate determination.** An in-sequence application message bearing
  `PossResend(97)=Y` is processed normally (the expected inbound seqnum advances) and delivered to the
  registered `Application::fromApp` with the full `MessageView` (tag 97 readable); the session never
  rejects, drops, or disconnects it for `97`, and `97` does NOT trigger the `OrigSendingTime(122)`-required
  rule (that keys on `43=Y` only). fixpp adds NO session-level PossResend logic — matching QuickFIX-cpp
  v1.16.0 and QuickFIX-J 3.0.1, which define the field but never read it in their session layers. The
  application must perform business-level de-duplication on its own keys (e.g. `ClOrdID`). **Status:
  shipped as witness-only** (022, zero production code — clarify-confirmed). *(FR-001..FR-005;

## Per-Session + Control-Plane Strand Binding (023-engine-session-strand)

### Feature Catalogue Rows

- **B-023-1 — The per-session strand binds the whole role loop + transport + both teardown
  closes.** Each engine-managed session runs its entire role loop (accept/connect, TLS
  handshake, read-pump, application callbacks, sends, and BOTH teardown closes — transport
  `close()` and terminal `Session::close()`) on a single `asio::strand` created per session
  (`SessionEntry::session_strand`); the transport I/O object is bound to that strand at every
  construction site (the four `asio_tls_transport` ctors + the listener-build + reconnect
  paths — INV-7/V-10). This serializes a session's TLS state against its in-flight read
  during teardown, fixing the flaky `BIO_ctrl` SEGV/UAF
  (`[[project_business_roundtrip_bio_ctrl_segv]]`). *(FR-005/FR-009; E-1/E-3/E-5; C-1/C-7.)*
- **B-023-2 — Engine-global control-plane state is serialized on a distinct control strand.**
  A single engine **control strand** (distinct from every session strand — INV-0) serializes
  ALL engine-global mutation AND `stop()`'s teardown reads: `registry_`, `listeners_`,
  `listener_endpoints_`, `accept_scope_signals_`, the outstanding/send counters, and the
  awaited handle publication/unpublication. `send` traverses caller→control→session; `stop`
  runs its whole teardown (snapshot/cancel/join/close-dispatch/clear) on the control strand —
  all non-blocking posts, no locks, no deadlock. *(FR-011/FR-012; E-0/E-2/E-4; C-0/C-2/C-6.)*
- **B-023-3 — Public synchronous readers are MT-safe via an atomically-published RCU
  snapshot; `lookup()` returns a bounded handle.** `lookup()` and `acceptor_bound_endpoint()`
  read an atomically-published immutable snapshot (`std::atomic<std::shared_ptr<const
  ReaderSnapshot>>`, standard C++20 — no `std::mutex` in our headers, §XV.9; republished on
  the control strand after every control-plane mutation) — never entering a session/control
  strand, a user-visible lock, or a blocking wait. **NOTE: this atomic is NOT lock-free**
  (`is_lock_free() == false` on the supported libc++/libstdc++ — `atomic<shared_ptr>` is
  implemented with an STL-internal lock pool); the read is wait-free of *engine* locks/strands
  but takes a brief STL-internal lock. The "lock-free" claim from earlier design notes is
  therefore dropped (V-6). Correctness is unaffected (no deadlock, no data race). `Engine::lookup()`
  changes from `Session*` to **`std::shared_ptr<Session>`** (the single recorded ABI change,
  FR-008/SC-004) — a **bounded handle**: the `Engine` must outlive any outstanding handle
  (`~Engine` debug-asserts zero outstanding leases; the lease is a debug-assert + caller
  obligation only, kept strictly separate from the `send_counter_` barrier — R7).
  *(FR-008/FR-014; E-7/INV-9/INV-9a; C-4/C-8.)*

### Limitations

- **L-023-1 — The bounded-handle `lookup()` lease is enforced in DEBUG only.** In debug
  builds `lookup()` returns an aliasing `std::shared_ptr<Session>` whose control block
  increments an engine-owned outstanding-lease counter (`~Engine` asserts it is zero). In
  release builds it is a plain `std::shared_ptr<Session>` with no counter; the
  Engine-outlives-handles precondition is a documented caller obligation, not enforced.
  **Status: by design** (R7 — never a `stop()` drain; draining on app-held leases would hang
  `stop()`). *(INV-9a; C-8; research.md R7.)*

- **L-023-2 — No dedicated `Engine::send` two-hop / establish-churn perf micro-bench
  (V-6 partial evidence).** The two-hop send (`caller→control→session`) and the D-SNAP
  snapshot read/republish are structurally new (no `Engine::send` bench existed pre-023), so
  there is no prior baseline to gate Article VIII ±5% against. A standalone micro-bench would
  be dominated by TLS-loopback setup (the strand hops are µs-scale), giving low signal. What
  IS recorded: the snapshot atomic `is_lock_free() == false` on the supported libc++/libstdc++
  (an STL-internal lock pool — see B-023-3). The binding correctness gate for this concurrency
  feature is TSan (full suite 388/388, exact witness set ×3 sanitizers). **Status: follow-up**
  — a dedicated send/establish-churn bench + baseline is a low-risk bench-only carry-forward
  (cf. the 012 RC#G handshake-bench scaffold precedent). *(V-6; research.md D7/D-SNAP;
  Article VIII.)*

## ResetOn{Logon,Logout,Disconnect} Lifecycle Reset Knobs (024-reset-refresh-on-logon)

### Behaviors

- **B-024-1 — Three `SessionConfig` knobs reset both sequence numbers to 1 at a session
  lifecycle event; default off.** `reset_on_logon` / `reset_on_logout` / `reset_on_disconnect`
  (all default `false`, QuickFIX cfg-key parity) trigger a durable reset to `{1,1}` —
  `SeqnumManager::reset_to_one()` then `MessageStore::reset()` — at, respectively, Logon, a
  Logout teardown (sent OR received), and ANY disconnect (incl. an abnormal drop). The reset
  reuses the `013` reset primitive via a shared `reset_seqnums_to_one_durable(disposition)`
  helper; it adds no new error slot, codegen, or wire field. **The initiator announces a
  ResetOnLogon via `ResetSeqNumFlag(141)=Y`** on its outbound Logon through an OR-of-three
  predicate (`(reset_on_logon || reset_on_logout || reset_on_disconnect) && seqnums=={1,1}`,
  evaluated against post-reset live state — matching QuickFIX-cpp `shouldSendReset()` /
  QuickFIX-J `isResetNeeded()`); a `reset_on_logout`/`reset_on_disconnect` session that reset
  to `{1,1}` at a prior teardown therefore also sets `141=Y` on its NEXT initiator Logon. The
  reset is wired at the **shared** initiator-Logon emission point (`emit_initiator_logon_()`),
  so it fires for both per-session-direct `open()` and engine-managed `drive_reconnect()`
  (initial lazy-connect + reconnect). The store-failure disposition is **cause-keyed**:
  knob-driven Logon = **fatal** (blocks `Active`); the `013`-only received-`141` path is
  **I-07 logged-then-proceed for non-persistent stores but fatal-when-persistent since 030**
  (see B-030-2); teardown = logged.
  The acceptor handles the two reset causes via a **cause-dependent split** (mutually exclusive
  arms): the knob-driven reset (`reset_on_logon==true`) runs **before** `check_inbound`
  (the `cfg_.reset_on_logon` fatal arm in `src/session/session.cpp`) so a fresh peer `34=1` at local-expected>1 is
  admitted; the 013-only received-`141` reset (`peer_sent_reset && !reset_on_logon`) runs
  **after** `check_inbound`. The arms are mutually exclusive → exactly
  one `store_->reset()` per path. A logout+disconnect teardown double-trigger collapses via
  a single-fire guard — each teardown also yields exactly one observable `MessageStore::reset()`
  (`FileStore::reset()` is non-idempotent I/O). *The cause-dependent split is retained for
  admission semantics (the knob-driven reset must precede `check_inbound`). The earlier rationale
  that the split "preserves `next_inbound`==1 byte-identity" for the 013-only arm is **superseded
  by 030**: 030 restores the received-`141` next-expected-**inbound** to 2 (the consumed seq-1
  reset Logon is a surviving advance — QuickFIX reset-then-increment parity), so the inbound
  post-state is now intentionally 2 while only the OUTBOUND reply stays byte-identical at seq 1.
  See B-030-1.*
  **Status: shipped** (024; received-`141` inbound post-state corrected by 030). *(FR-001..FR-010; C2.1–C5.2; data-model disposition table.)*

### Limitations

## RefreshOnLogon — per-logon re-hydrate knob (025-refresh-on-logon)

### Feature Catalogue Rows

- **S-018** (session) — RefreshOnLogon — reload persisted state on reconnect — `backlog → done`.
  FIX 4.0–5.0SP2, FIXT.1.1.

### Behaviors

*(The re-hydrate-on-logon behavior is described by the S-018 catalogue row; see
`feature-catalogue.md`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-025-1 — A `refresh_on_logon` re-hydrate on an ACTIVE session can transiently set the
  manager's inbound or outbound counter to a value BELOW the previously-seen in-memory high-water
  mark (store-wins DOWN, INV-RoL-4).** This is the design intent for standby topologies where the
  store reflects a primary's authoritative counter; it is NOT a violation of the 029 INV-H1
  lower-bound (which is a store ≤ manager store-side invariant, not a manager monotonicity
  constraint). However, operators using `refresh_on_logon=true` in a configuration where the
  store can lag behind the in-memory counter (e.g. a single-node session reconnecting after a
  partial in-memory-only run) should be aware that the re-hydrate will regress the in-memory
  counter to the store's (lower) value — potentially causing duplicate-seqnum acceptance or
  replay. This is suppressed by `reset_seqnum_policy = bilateral_strict` (INV-RoL-3), which
  prevents the re-hydrate entirely; under `bilateral_strict` the knob is a no-op and the
  managed counter is monotonic. `refresh_on_logon=true` is intended for **standby-only**
  topologies where the authoritative source is the external store (shared with the primary).
  **Status: documented** (research D-RoL-6; data-model.md INV-RoL-3/INV-RoL-4;
  contracts/refresh-knob.md C4). *(catalogue S-018; `session.cpp` `refresh_active_`
  suppression; test W5a INV-RoL-3 witness.)*

- **L-025-2 — The acceptor `force=true` warm re-hydrate path in `Session::ensure_hydrated_` is not
  reachable through the current engine and has no reachable test vehicle.** The production engine
  (`run_accept_loop` in `src/session/engine.cpp`) constructs a **fresh** `Session` per accepted connection; `hydrated_` is set
  at first logon and never reset, so every acceptor Logon arrives on a Session with
  `hydrated_==false` (the `hydrated_ && !force` latch check in `Session::ensure_hydrated_`, `src/session/session.cpp`, never sees `force=true` bypass it on the acceptor side).
  A 2nd Logon received in `Active` state is dispatched to the dup-Logon-in-Active `Reject` arm,
  not back through the `NotConnected` Logon handler. The acceptor `force` wiring is therefore
  **dead-but-harmless**: it is correctly wired and would function if Session reuse across acceptor
  reconnect is introduced (deferred). FR-002's per-2nd+-logon re-hydrate is witnessed for the
  **initiator** role (W1/W2/W7); the acceptor receives the same re-hydrate semantics on each new
  connection via the 029 cold-hydrate spine (fresh Session → fresh `ensure_hydrated_()` call on
  the first Logon). **Status: documented, acceptor same-connection re-Logon force-bypass deferred
  pending Session reuse.** *(data-model.md W6 scope; catalogue S-018; `Session::ensure_hydrated_` in `src/session/session.cpp`.)*

## Nanosecond-resolution SendingTime (026-nanosecond-sendingtime)

### Feature Catalogue Rows

- **S-039** (session) — Configurable SendingTime(52) emit precision incl. nanoseconds + lenient
  inbound UTCTimestamp parse — `backlog → done`.

### Behaviors

- **B-026-1 — A per-session `fix_time_precision` selects `SendingTime(52)` emit precision
  (including nanoseconds); inbound parsing is leniently width-tolerant; `OrigSendingTime(122)`
  is preserved verbatim; default `millis` is a byte-identical no-op.** `SessionConfig::sending_time_precision`
  (`fix_time_precision`, default `millis`) controls the precision of every **newly-stamped
  outbound `SendingTime(52)`**: `nanos` emits the 27-char `YYYYMMDD-HH:MM:SS.sssssssss` form,
  `micros` the 24-char form, `millis` (default) the 21-char FIX 4.x form. The precision threads
  compile-time-exhaustively (non-defaulted parameter) through both stamp helpers
  (`session::stamp_sending_time`, file-local `stamp_sending_time(Clock&)`) and all 21 call sites
  — a missed site is a build error, not a silent wrong-precision frame. The inbound parser
  (`core::fix_string_to_utc_time`) is **lenient**: it accepts a bare length-17 timestamp OR a
  `.` at index 17 followed by any 1–9 sub-second digits (total length 19–27), scaling an N-digit
  fraction to nanoseconds by `10^(9−N)` — so a counterparty's nanos (or any non-standard-width)
  `52=`/`122=` parses instead of being rejected (Postel's law; matches QuickFIX-cpp). Malformed
  fractions reject via `wire_invalid_field_format`: empty fraction (`…SS.`), a non-digit fraction
  char, or >9 digits (caught by an explicit **width/length gate** before any digit parse — a
  10-digit value fits in `int64` and would not trip an arithmetic overflow). `OrigSendingTime(122)`
  on a PossDup resend echoes the **stored original** `52=` bytes verbatim — `build_replay_frame`
  byte-copies them, never re-stamping at the configured precision. MaxLatency (S-019) operates
  correctly on the parsed ns instant with no boundary-logic change. Default `millis` ⇒ every
  outbound `52=` is byte-identical to the pre-feature baseline. No new wire field, error slot,
  codegen, or C-ABI surface (formatter reuses `decimal_buffer_too_small`; parser reuses
  `wire_invalid_field_format`). **Status: shipped** (026). *(FR-001..FR-009; SC-001..SC-005;
  contract C1–C7; data-model E1–E6 / I-NST-1..6.)*

### Limitations

- **L-026-1 — Achieved sub-second resolution is bounded by the platform `system_clock::period`;
  FIXT/version-gating of sub-second precision is deferred to G4.** When `nanos` is selected the
  wire FORMAT is always 9 digits, but the achieved resolution reflects the clock's true tick:
  full nanoseconds on libstdc++ (Tier-1 Linux), coarser on platforms whose `system_clock` ticks
  at ~100 ns (e.g. MSVC, Tier-2) — there the trailing digits are `00`, a documented platform
  nuance, not a defect. fixpp is FIX.4.4-scoped, so the QuickFIX-cpp/J FIX4.2+/FIXT
  `supportsSubSecondTimestamps` version-gate is moot here; it becomes relevant when FIXT.1.1 /
  5.0SP2 land (G4). **Status: documented** — version-gating tracked for G4. *(research D6;
  spec Edge Cases; contract C6.)*

## Per-Session NextExpectedMsgSeqNum(789) fast resume (027-next-expected-msgseqnum)

### Feature Catalogue Rows

- **S-031** (session) — NextExpectedMsgSeqNum(789) in Logon — fast session resume without
  ResendRequest round-trip — `backlog → implementation-parity-4.4`.
  FIX 4.4 parity only; FIXT.1.1 / 5.0SP2 outstanding to G4.

### Behaviors

- **B-027-1 — Per-session `NextExpectedMsgSeqNum(789)`: advertise next-expected-inbound in
  Logon; honor a peer's 789 with a proactive resend that eliminates the ResendRequest
  round-trip; X>N or present-but-invalid 789 ⇒ Logout+disconnect; default off byte-identical;
  FIX 4.4 only.**
  When `SessionConfig::enable_next_expected_msg_seq_num` is `true` (default `false`),
  fixpp appends tag `789=<next_inbound>` to every outbound Logon (both the initiator's opening
  Logon and the acceptor's reply), where `<next_inbound>` is `seqnum_mgr_.next_inbound_unsafe()`
  — plain, no `+1` (the acceptor reply is built post-`check_inbound` which already advanced
  the counter, so the read is already correct; matches research D-3/E-OBO). When an inbound
  Logon carries `789=X`: (a) present-but-invalid X (parse→0, empty, non-digit, overflow) ⇒
  `Logout`+disconnect — evaluated **before** the X<N compare to close the `[1,N-1]`
  full-history-amplification path (research D-10, contract C6); (b) X>N (peer expects more
  than we have sent) ⇒ `Logout("NextExpectedMsgSeqNum too high …")`+disconnect (FR-005);
  (c) X<N ⇒ proactive resend `replay_outbound_range_(X, N-1, through_current=true)` with
  PossDup app frames + GapFill admin frames — no `ResendRequest` round-trip; (d) X==N ⇒
  in sync, no resend. The comparison basis is outbound: N = `seqnum_mgr_.peek_outbound()`
  (I-NEX-11 — never confused with the inbound counter). The acceptor's proactive resend runs
  AFTER the reply `store_then_emit` (the "027 T014/T021 — acceptor 789 honor" RC#4-ordering comment in `src/session/session.cpp`). Default off (`false`) ⇒ outbound
  Logon byte-identical to pre-feature baseline; inbound `789` ignored; existing `ResendRequest`
  recovery (013) untouched. FIX 4.4 only — no FIXT / 5.0 version-gating this slice (G4).
  **Status: shipped** (027). *(FR-001..FR-009; SC-001..SC-005; contracts C1–C10; data-model
  E1–E3, I-NEX-1..12; `tests/session/test_next_expected_msgseqnum.cpp`;
  `tests/interop/happy/hp_fix44_next_expected_test.cpp`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-027-1 — 789 is both-peers-required; there is NO automatic ResendRequest fallback at
  logon when only one side enables the knob.** When `enable_next_expected_msg_seq_num=true`
  and the peer's inbound Logon carries NO `789`, the at-logon ResendRequest is suppressed
  (FR-004 suppression is unconditional when the knob is on). If fixpp has an at-logon gap
  and the peer does not send `789`, the gap is NOT proactively filled at logon time — it will
  only self-heal when the Active too-high arm emits a `ResendRequest` on the first in-sequence
  frame whose seqnum exposes the gap. Operators MUST enable `789` on BOTH endpoints (QFcpp:
  `EnableNextExpectedMsgSeqNum=Y`; QFJ: `EnableNextExpectedMsgSeqNum=Y`). This matches
  QuickFIX-cpp v1.16.0 and QuickFIX-J 3.0.1, which likewise have no automatic fallback.
  **Status: by design** (FR-004/FR-009, L-027-1 deliberate divergence from a hypothetical
  mixed-mode). *(research D-7/D-11; contract C5/C9; data-model I-NEX-10.)*

- **L-027-2 — A lost proactive resend self-heals via the Active too-high arm on the next
  inbound frame; a permanent no-recover hole cannot arise from the current codebase.**
  When the behind-side partner sent 789=X and expected to receive `[X, N-1]` proactively but
  the proactive resend was lost (e.g. a transport error after the Logon exchange), the behind
  side's `next_inbound_` is still at X. The first in-sequence active frame from the far side
  (seqnum M > X) hits the `Active` too-high arm, which issues a `ResendRequest`
  for `[X, M-1]` — recovering the gap via the normal recovery path. A true never-recover hole
  would only arise if a future change ALSO suppressed the Active too-high arm when the knob is
  on, which the current code does not do (T017 review comment annotates this arm as
  recovery-of-last-resort — stays active regardless of knob state). **Status: documented**
  (research D-11, data-model I-NEX-10). *(contracts C5; the too-high inbound seqnum → AwaitingResend arm in `src/session/session.cpp`; T017 annotation.)*

## Validation-compat toggles — CheckCompID & ValidateSequenceNumbers (028-validation-compat-toggles)

### Behaviors

- **B-028-1 — `check_comp_id=false` skips the steady-state SenderCompID/TargetCompID match;
  BeginString, Logon-establishment CompID, and 013 authz remain strict; default byte-identical.**
  `SessionConfig::check_comp_id` (default `true`) controls the per-message `49`/`56` equality
  gate in the `LogonReceived/Active` inbound handler. When `false`, a frame whose
  `SenderCompID(49)` or `TargetCompID(56)` does not match the configured pair is **accepted and
  delivered** instead of triggering a disconnect (FR-001/FR-002). Three gates are deliberately
  left strict regardless of the knob: (a) `BeginString(8)` mismatch still disconnects
  (I-VCT-1); (b) the Logon-establishment CompID check in `interpret_logon` is unaffected —
  a Logon whose `49` ≠ configured `target_comp_id` is still refused (steady-state-only scope,
  I-VCT-6, FR-012); (c) the 013 `compid_authorization_policy` allow-list still refuses a
  non-allow-listed principal at Logon time (I-VCT-2). Default `true` ⇒ byte-identical no-op.
  QuickFIX-compat: QFcpp `CheckCompID=N` / QFJ `CheckCompID=N`. *(FR-001/002/003/012;
  data-model I-VCT-1/2/6; research D-2; contracts C1; `tests/session/test_validation_compat_toggles.cpp`.)*

- **B-028-2 — `validate_sequence_numbers=false` tolerates out-of-order inbound: no
  ResendRequest on a forward gap, no disconnect on a too-low; counter advances on exact match
  only; `SequenceReset(35=4) NewSeqNo` not applied; PossDup + `seq==0` + too-low-Heartbeat
  carve-outs retained; default byte-identical.**
  `SessionConfig::validate_sequence_numbers` (default `true`) controls four inbound seqnum
  enforcement sites in the `LogonReceived/Active` handler. When `false`: (1) too-high inbound
  (`seq > next_expected`) does NOT enter AwaitingResend and does NOT emit a `ResendRequest`
  (site S2); the frame falls through to a deliver-without-advance path (site S4). (2) too-low
  inbound (`seq < next_expected`) does NOT disconnect; the frame is delivered to `fromAdmin`
  (admin `MsgType`) or `fromApp` (app `MsgType`) via `parse_and_dispatch_` — counter unchanged,
  session stays `Active` (site S4, FR-004/005). (3) reset-mode `SequenceReset(35=4)` (site S6,
  before the seqnum gate) — the `apply_inbound_sequence_reset` intercept is bypassed; frame
  delivered to `fromAdmin`, counter unchanged (FR-013/I-VCT-11). (4) gapfill-mode
  `SequenceReset(35=4, 123=Y)` (site S7, after the seqnum gate) — same bypass; `NewSeqNo` NOT
  applied; an exact-match gapfill `35=4` that already advanced the counter by +1 via S5 does
  NOT additionally apply `NewSeqNo`. The inbound counter advances on exact match only
  (unchanged S5 path). Four carve-outs are retained regardless of the knob: PossDup Stage-1/
  Stage-2 handling runs on both the exact-match and out-of-order arms (I-VCT-5); `seq==0`
  (unparseable `MsgSeqNum`) remains fatal (I-VCT-10); too-low `Heartbeat(35=0)` is still
  silently dropped pre-gate (N3 carve-out at site S3); Logon-time seqnum checks are unchanged
  (steady-state-only scope, I-VCT-6, FR-012). Default `true` ⇒ byte-identical no-op.
  QuickFIX-compat: QFJ `ValidateSequenceNumbers=N`. *(FR-004/005/006/013/012;
  data-model I-VCT-3/4/5/10/11; research D-3; contracts C2; `tests/session/test_validation_compat_toggles.cpp`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-028-1 — `validate_sequence_numbers=false` disables gap detection — real gaps are silently
  accepted and messages may be processed out of order.** With the knob off, fixpp makes no
  attempt to detect or recover a missing message range: a forward gap simply delivers the
  higher-seqnum frame without issuing a `ResendRequest`, and the missed messages are never
  requested. This means the application layer may receive frames out of order or miss frames
  entirely. This knob is intended ONLY for counterparties that are known to send out-of-order
  frames as a deliberate protocol choice (e.g. a QuickFIX-J peer configured
  `ValidateSequenceNumbers=N`); using it against a conformant FIX peer will hide real gaps.
  **Status: by design** (FR-005/FR-006; research D-0/D-3; L-028-3 is the steady-state-only
  companion). *(data-model I-VCT-3; contracts C2.2.)*

- **L-028-2 — `check_comp_id=false` removes the steady-state mis-routing guard — a message
  addressed to a different CompID pair is accepted; rely on 013 authz + transport binding.**
  With the knob off, an inbound frame bearing any `SenderCompID(49)` / `TargetCompID(56)` pair
  is delivered as long as it passes the strict gates (BeginString, Logon-establishment CompID,
  013 `compid_authorization_policy`). The steady-state mis-routing guard that would normally
  reject a cross-session frame is absent. Operators using this knob should ensure adequate
  security via mTLS transport binding (where the 013 allow-list verifies the TLS identity ↔
  CompID mapping) or by ensuring the network topology is point-to-point. This knob is intended
  for counterparties known to send inconsistent CompIDs (e.g. a QuickFIX counterparty
  configured `CheckCompID=N`). **Status: by design** (FR-002/FR-003; research D-0/D-2;
  L-028-3 is the steady-state-only companion). *(data-model I-VCT-2; contracts C1.2.)*

- **L-028-3 — Both relaxations are steady-state only — Logon establishment is unaffected by
  either knob; a counterparty needing relaxed Logon-time checks is not supported.** The
  `check_comp_id` and `validate_sequence_numbers` knobs apply exclusively to the
  `LogonReceived/Active` inbound handler. The Logon-establishment paths (`NotConnected` /
  `LogonSent`) are deliberately left strict: a Logon with a mismatched `SenderCompID(49)` is
  still refused, and a Logon-time too-high `MsgSeqNum` still disconnects, regardless of either
  knob. This is a deliberate divergence from QuickFIX-J, which routes Logon through the same
  `verify()` method and therefore relaxes at Logon too (`ValidateSequenceNumbers=N` also
  suppresses Logon-time too-high checks in QFJ). The fixpp restriction keeps Logon
  establishment strict for safe session bring-up and avoids entangling the 013/024 reset FSM.
  **Status: by design** (clarify Q3 / D-4; steady-state-only scope). *(data-model I-VCT-6;

## Persistent seqnum continuity — bidirectional hydrate-on-open (029-persistent-seqnum-hydrate)

### Feature Catalogue Rows

- **S-042** (session) — Persistent inbound seqnum continuity — durable inbound counter +
  bidirectional hydrate-on-open; resume both directions across restart — `backlog → done`.
  FIX 4.4.

### Behaviors

*(The hydrate-on-open and persist-inbound-advance behaviors are described by the S-042 catalogue
row; see `feature-catalogue.md`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-029-1 — Post-GapFill restart yields a bounded redundant ResendRequest when 789/reset is
  available; otherwise the too-high peer Logon fatals on the Logon gate and recovers by
  reconnect; recovery is correct at-least-once in both cases.** The `persist_inbound_advance_()`
  helper uses `+1` per-delivery writes only — there is no absolute counter-set in the
  `MessageStore` interface (preserving the 4-pure-virtual cap). A prior-run
  `SequenceReset`-GapFill absolute jump (`apply_inbound_sequence_reset`) updates the in-memory
  manager but is NOT persisted. On restart the persisted counter is a **monotonic lower bound**
  of the true in-memory value (INV-H1). If the peer's outbound counter advanced past the restart
  point (e.g. it sent messages after the GapFill that the fixpp side accepted), the peer's next
  Logon will carry a `MsgSeqNum(34)` above fixpp's hydrated `next_inbound`. Two outcomes
  depending on knob state: (a) **`enable_next_expected_msg_seq_num=true`** — fixpp advertises
  `789=<hydrated_next_inbound>` in its Logon; the peer proactively resends or fixpp emits a
  `ResendRequest` for the gap; session reaches Active, residual gap recovered; bounded redundant
  resend (at most the untracked GapFill jump range). (b) **knob off** — the Logon gate has no
  ResendRequest arm; a too-high peer `MsgSeqNum(34)` triggers a fatal
  Logout+disconnect at the Logon-path check; the session reconnects and the peer resets to `1`
  (ResetOnLogon) or the gap resolves after a further handshake. Recovery is correct (at-least-once,
  no skip) in both cases; case (b) incurs an extra reconnect cycle. Operators using persistent
  stores and SequenceReset-GapFill recovery should enable `enable_next_expected_msg_seq_num` on
  both sides (QFcpp `EnableNextExpectedMsgSeqNum=Y` / QFJ `EnableNextExpectedMsgSeqNum=Y`) to
  stay on the fast-recover path. **Status: documented** (INV-H1; research D-5; plan §VI delta
  L-029-1; data-model W5/SC-004). *(contracts/seqnum-hydrate.md C2/C3; `session.cpp`
  `apply_inbound_sequence_reset`; `tests/session/test_persistent_seqnum_hydrate.cpp` W5.)*

- **L-029-2 — A swallowed I-07 outbound store-write failure in a prior run leaves the persisted
  outbound counter behind the true last-sent value; hydrate is only as fresh as the last
  successful outbound write.** The existing outbound store write (added in 008/024) is I-07
  logged-then-proceed — an outbound `next_seqnum(outbound,true)` failure is logged but does NOT
  disconnect the session (asymmetric with the inbound path where failure is fatal, per research
  D-3). If this outbound write silently fails mid-session, the FileStore's persisted outbound
  counter is behind the true `next_outbound_`. On restart, `ensure_hydrated_()` reads the stale
  persisted value and loads it into the manager — the restarted session may replay seqnums the
  peer has already seen, causing a too-low reject or unexpected seqnum jump. This is a
  **pre-existing 008/024 property** (the I-07 policy predates 029); 029 adds the hydrate path
  that makes the stale-write scenario observable but does not alter the I-07 policy. The correct
  fix (promote the outbound write failure to fatal-disconnect, matching the inbound treatment) is
  deferred as a separate store-hardening slice. Operators relying on persisted outbound counters
  should ensure the underlying `MessageStore` (e.g. `FileStore`) operates on a reliable
  filesystem. **Status: documented** (research D-3 / plan §VI delta L-029-2; pre-existing
  008/024 I-07 policy; outbound→fatal deferred). *(contracts/seqnum-hydrate.md C3; `file_store.cpp`
  outbound-write path; `tests/session/test_persistent_seqnum_hydrate.cpp` NoHeap witness.)*

- **L-029-3 — Under `reset_seqnum_policy = bilateral_strict` with a non-1 persisted outbound
  counter, the 029 cold-open hydrate seeds the manager at the stored (non-1) outbound value
  and the cold Logon is then emitted with `141=Y` AND `34=<N>` (N > 1), which is malformed per
  FIX spec when a peer validates that `ResetSeqNumFlag(141)=Y` implies `MsgSeqNum(34)=1`.
  This is a property of the `bilateral_strict` cold-open path (029's one-shot `ensure_hydrated_`
  seeds from a non-1 store, then the strict policy adds `141=Y` unconditionally); 025 does NOT
  close this gap — the per-reconnect re-hydrate (025) is suppressed under `bilateral_strict`
  (INV-RoL-3), so 025 introduces no new exposure. QuickFIX-cpp/J peers that enforce the
  `141=Y`→`34=1` invariant will reject the cold Logon; the session will disconnect+reconnect
  until the peer or the store is reset. Operators should use `bilateral_lenient` or
  `unilateral` policy when the persisted outbound counter may be > 1 at cold open.
  **Status: documented, DEFERRED** (Gate A D-RoL-6; data-model.md W5b L-029-3 gap-witness;

## Received-reset inbound advance correction (030-received-reset-inbound-advance)

### Feature Catalogue Rows

- Amends **S-017** (received-`141` reset machinery), **S-031** (789 advertisement),
  **S-032** (ResetSeqNumFlag(141)). No new S-row — this is a conformance correction of the
  existing received-`141` path, found via a failed live acceptor interop cell vs QuickFIX-cpp/J.

### Behaviors

- **B-030-1 — A received `Logon(141=Y)` advances next-expected-**inbound** to 2 (not 1) on
  both the acceptor and the initiator arm; the outbound reply stays seq 1.** When a peer
  initiates a sequence reset by sending `Logon(34=1, 141=Y)` and the local `reset_on_logon`
  knob is OFF (the "received-141" path), the consumed seq-1 reset Logon is an in-sequence
  message: after the post-`check_inbound` durable reset, fixpp restores next-expected-inbound
  to `seqnum_min+1` (=2) in BOTH the in-memory `SeqnumManager` (`set_next_inbound`) AND the
  durable store (a `next_seqnum(inbound, true)` write-through → `store == manager == 2`,
  INV-H1 equality). This matches QuickFIX-cpp/J, which **reset-then-increment** (net 2);
  fixpp previously increment-then-reset (net 1), which left next-expected-inbound at 1 and
  emitted a **spurious `ResendRequest`** on the peer's next genuine message at seq 2 (and,
  with 027 enabled, advertised `789=1` instead of `2`). The correction is applied symmetrically
  on the two separate-but-identical code paths: the acceptor `NotConnected` Logon handler and
  the initiator Logon-ack `peer_ack_sent_reset_flag` arm (FR-009). The **OUTBOUND reply Logon
  `MsgSeqNum` stays seq 1** (independent counter; byte-identical); only the reply `789` content
  corrects 1→2 (acceptor-reply-specific, 027-on). The `reset_on_logon=true` knob path is
  unchanged (already produced 2). **Status: shipped** (030). *(FR-001..FR-009; reference oracle
  QFcpp `Session.cpp::nextLogon` reset-then-increment, QFJ `Session.java` lines 2202-2204/2215/

- **B-030-2 — On a persistent store, a received-`141` durable-reset failure now DISCONNECTS
  (was stay-Active); non-persistent stores keep stay-Active.** This amends the 024 FR-001/C2.6
  I-07 "logged-then-proceed" contract for the persistent received-`141` sub-case. Rationale: a
  swallowed (`logged`) store-reset failure on a persistent store would leave the durable counter
  stale, and the B-030-1 persist-to-2 write-through would then advance the **stale** store
  (N→N+1) — for any session that had received messages this yields `store > manager` (INV-H1
  violation → silent inbound skip on restart, the 029 over-persist harm). Making the reset
  **fatal when the store is persistent** (`store_is_persistent_ ? fatal : logged`, on both arms)
  guarantees the reset succeeded before persist-to-2 runs, so `store == manager == 2` truly holds;
  a reset failure disconnects, the session re-opens, re-hydrates the store at its last-good value
  N (a valid INV-H1 lower bound), and the peer re-drives the reset — resuming with nothing skipped.
  Non-persistent
  stores are unaffected (the reset cannot meaningfully fail; INV-H4 makes persist-to-2 a no-op).
  Aligns with 029 D-3 ("inbound-correctness failures are fatal") and the existing fatal knob-reset
  sites. **Status: shipped** (030). *(FR-010; amends B-024-1; `tests/session/test_reset_on_lifecycle.cpp`
  fault-injection witnesses + the persistent-Disconnect / non-persistent-stay-Active contract split.)*

- **B-031-1 — As an acceptor, fixpp honors a peer initiator's `NextExpectedMsgSeqNum(789)`
  against its PRE-reply next-outbound (`N_pre`), so an in-sync peer triggers no resend and the
  session establishes with no duplicate-sequence frame.** With the `789` knob on, the acceptor
  emits its reply Logon first and then honors the peer's advertised `789` (the deliberate 027
  RC#4 ordering). Because the reply Logon consumes a sequence number, the live next-outbound at
  honor time is the **post-reply** `N_post = N_pre+1`. fixpp previously compared the peer's `789`
  against `N_post`; a conformant in-sync peer advertises `789 = N_pre` (its expected target, no
  `+1`), so `N_pre < N_post` mis-classified the peer as behind-by-one and emitted a spurious
  `SequenceReset-GapFill` at the sequence number the reply Logon had just used — a duplicate-
  `MsgSeqNum` violation that QuickFIX-cpp/J reject with a "MsgSeqNum too low" `Logout`, so the
  session never established (live-found, invisible to in-process 027 unit tests; parallels 030).
  The honor now compares against `N_pre` (captured before the reply consumes a seq; parameterized
  `honor_peer_next_expected_(…, next_outbound_ref)`) for all three arms: in-sync `X==N_pre` ⇒ no
  resend; too-high `X>N_pre` ⇒ Logout (so `X==N_pre+1` in the peer's initial Logon is correctly
  too-high, not in-sync); genuine-gap `X<N_pre` ⇒ proactive resend `[X, N_pre]` (range unchanged,
  reads live `peek_outbound()-1`). The **initiator** honor is byte-identical (its peer-reply
  `789 = target+1` already matches fixpp's post-own-Logon outbound; it passes the current
  `peek_outbound()`). Reference-engine-conformant (QFcpp `Session.cpp:228/277/687/709`; QFJ
  `Session.java:2250/2312/2334` evaluate the decision against the pre-reply sender counter).
  **Status: shipped** (031). *(FR-001..FR-009; `tests/session/test_next_expected_msgseqnum.cpp`
  W1 `Acceptor_XeqNpre_NoResend_Establishes` + W3 `Acceptor_XeqNprePlus1_TooHigh_Logout`; live
  close-out via the `NE-*-acc` interop cell vs QFcpp/QFJ.)*

- **B-032-1 — As an initiator, fixpp restores its OUTBOUND seqnum to 2 (not 1) when the peer
  echoes fixpp's own `141=Y`, so it carries one post-logon frame at `34=2` with no duplicate
  `34=1`.** A `reset_on_logon`/`reset_on_logout`/`reset_on_disconnect` initiator that reset before
  sending emits `Logon(141=Y, 34=1)` (outbound 1→2); a conformant peer (QFcpp/QFJ) echoes `141=Y`
  in its Logon ack. fixpp's `peer_ack_sent_reset_flag` arm reset-rewinds both counters to 1; 030
  restored the inbound twin but outbound regressed 2→1 → the next frame duplicated `34=1` →
  QFcpp/QFJ reject "MsgSeqNum too low" (L-024-2, live-found). The arm now restores outbound to 2
  (`set_next_outbound(seqnum_min+1)` + `persist_outbound_advance_`, manager-first/store-second,
  fatal-when-persistent — the outbound twin of B-030-1) gated on BOTH a latched emit-time fact
  (`own_logon_sent_reset_flag_` = fixpp actually emitted `141=Y`, which carries the inbound-at-1
  conjunct) AND `reset_before_send` (fixpp's Logon went at post-reset seq 1). The reset-event
  `by_peer_request` now keys on the latch ALONE — correcting the prior `bilateral_strict`-only
  classification for non-strict reset-knob initiators. Restore (latch && reset-before-send) and
  label (latch alone) are DISTINCT gates that diverge on `bilateral_strict`-at-N (latch true, no
  restore). Covers all reset knobs via the emit-time latch; acceptor / knob-off / peer-spontaneous
  / `bilateral_strict`-at-N outbound unchanged (byte-identical). Reference-engine-conformant
  (QuickFIX reset-then-increment). **Status: shipped** (032). *(FR-001/FR-003/FR-005/FR-006/FR-007;

### Limitations

- None specific to 030/031 (both conformance corrections; no new deferred surface). The pre-existing
  L-029-1 (post-GapFill bounded redundant resend) and L-029-3 (`bilateral_strict` non-1 cold-open
  malformed Logon) are unchanged.

## FIXT.1.1 / FIX 5.0 SP2 Session Establishment (033-fixt-fix50sp2-session)

### Behaviors

**B-033-1 — FIXT.1.1 / FIX 5.0 SP2 session establishment (transport/application version decoupling).**
When `SessionConfig::version` selects a FIXT.1.1 profile, the session layer emits `BeginString=FIXT.1.1`
and enforces the transport/application version split. Both roles (initiator and acceptor) emit
`DefaultApplVerID(1137)` on the outbound Logon (FR-001/FR-002); the acceptor requires and validates the
peer's `1137` field (FR-003/FR-004). The `negotiated_version_profile()` accessor on `Session` exposes
the negotiated application version after establishment (FR-005); on the **initiator**, a peer Logon-ack
that omits `1137` or carries an unserviceable value leaves the profile at the unnegotiated fallback
`{session=Unknown, default_appl=Unknown}` (the initiator does not auto-reject — see L-033-3). The implementation is version-general:
any application-layer `ApplVerID` enum value accepted for `1137` is valid; acceptors reject only values
they are not configured to service (FR-004a, acceptor-scoped only). When FIXT.1.1 is **not** configured,
the FIX.4.x path is byte-identical — no wire change, no protocol divergence (FR-009/SC-002). *(FR-001
through FR-006, FR-009; `tests/session/test_fixt_logon_establishment.cpp` W1/W2/W3/W4/W5/W8.)*

**B-033-2 — Optional `Username(553)`/`Password(554)` on FIXT Logon; surfaced to `authorize_logon` seam.**
When `SessionConfig::logon_credentials` contains a username and/or password, the session layer emits
`Username(553)` and `Password(554)` on the outbound Logon (FR-006/FR-007). Inbound `553`/`554` are
parsed and surfaced to the registered `CompIdAuthorizationPolicy::authorize_logon(asserted_compid,
logon_credentials)` callback (FR-007/FR-008). The default policy implementation is accept-all; the seam
is independent of the mTLS `verify_peer` path. A credential-free FIXT Logon (no `553`/`554` received)
is accepted normally — credentials are optional per FIX-SL §4.3. `Password(554)` is redacted via the
shared `redact_tag554` utility before any persistence operation (W7). *(FR-006, FR-007, FR-008;
`tests/session/test_fixt_credentials.cpp` W6/W7.)*

### Limitations

**L-033-1 — Per-message `ApplVerID(1128)` routing (S-026) deferred.** Inbound `ApplVerID(1128)` is
tolerated (not rejected) when present on application messages (FR-010, witness W8). However, per-message
routing — using `1128` to select a message-type-specific application-layer version and dispatch
accordingly — is **not implemented** in this feature. It remains in `backlog` as a follow-on feature.
Operators relying on per-message versioning via `1128` should implement routing at the `fromApp` level.

**L-033-2 — Acceptor-side credential validation/rejection deferred (FR-008a).** The `authorize_logon`
seam is wired and surfaces parsed `553`/`554` values to the registered policy. However, the default
`CompIdAuthorizationPolicy` implementation is accept-all: no built-in credential database, no
configuration-driven reject path. Acceptors that need to reject Logons based on credential mismatch must
supply a custom `CompIdAuthorizationPolicy` implementation. A built-in config-gated validation/rejection
path is a committed future feature (FR-008a).

**L-033-3 — Initiator-side `1137` validation (unserviceable AND absent) is deliberately deferred to the
application.** FR-004a (unserviceable application version → `Reject` + Disconnect, NOT a Logout message)
is **acceptor-scoped only**. The initiator's Logon-ack arm (033 T018 — FIXT initiator, in `src/session/session.cpp`)
records the peer's `DefaultApplVerID(1137)` only when it is present **and** maps to a known
`application_version`, and **never refuses on any value** — there is no automatic initiator-side disposal
path for a peer `1137` the initiator cannot service. The two non-conforming inputs and their concrete
shipped dispositions:

- **Unserviceable `1137`-ack** (present but unmappable / a version the initiator cannot service): the
  value is not recorded; `negotiated_appl_version_` stays `Unknown`; the session still reaches Active.
- **Absent `1137`-ack** (the peer Logon-ack omits `1137` entirely): the `result->default_appl_ver_id`
  optional is empty, the record-arm condition is false, `negotiated_appl_version_` stays `Unknown`, and
  the session still reaches Active. (The acceptor, by contrast, rejects a missing `1137` with
  `RequiredTagMissing(1)` per FR-004 — see B-033-1 / the FIXT establishment notes; the asymmetry is
  intentional and acceptor-scoped.)

In both initiator cases `negotiated_version_profile()` returns the unnegotiated fallback
`{session=Unknown, default_appl=Unknown}` (in `src/session/session.cpp`), which a downstream `fromApp` reify
call-site can detect. An initiator requiring strict application-version negotiation must enforce it in
its `authorize_logon` / `fromAdmin` hooks. **Status: deferred-by-design** (no auto-dispose on the
initiator; not an open question — a built-in initiator-side strict-`1137` gate would be its own future
feature).

**L-033-4 — `Password(554)` redaction wired at unit-golden + interop-golden; production
logger/tap/transcript wiring is a forward obligation.** The `redact_tag554` utility is wired at the
unit-test golden layer (W7) and (US3 T026, 2026-06-12) at the interop-golden layer — a Python
`_redact_tag554` twin in `run_interop_cell.py`'s `normalize_transcript` AND `_transcript_to_inrepo_golden`
(no-op for the credential-free happy cells, but fail-closed at both persistence sites). Production
session-logger, tap-consumer, and transport-transcript wiring of the redactor is deferred — those
surfaces are no-hook stubs in 033 (see L-017-* for the logger/tap framework limitations).

## Fable assessment follow-ups (out-of-band, 2026-06-13)

These rows document **already-shipped behavior** surfaced by the independent Fable review pass
(`research/G19-fix-fpml-iso20022/fable-assessments/`). They were added out-of-band (no feature cycle)
because the underlying behavior is accepted-as-shipped for v1.0 (no code fix). Per-feature IDs are kept
so the **Tier-4 release-gate B&L back-fill** (REMAINING-WORK item 9) can relocate the `008` rows into a
proper 008 section. Code-fix follow-ups (credential masking, toAdmin coverage, GapFill 43=Y/122,
file_store offload) are tracked in `REMAINING-WORK.md` "Fable review findings (2026-06-13)", NOT here.

**B-034-1 — `Password(554)` on the outbound Logon is MASKED before persistence (at-rest exposure
mitigated).** *(was L-033-6; fixed by 034-credential-store-redaction.)* When a FIXT session has
`SessionConfig::logon_credentials.password` set AND any `store_factory` is configured, the `554` value is
overwritten in place with a same-length `'*'` run **before** the frame enters the message store, at the
single store-entry boundary `Session::store_then_emit` — so every store backend (FileStore, MemoryStore,
null) persists the masked frame on both the initiator emit and the acceptor reply, and no cleartext
password is at rest. The **wire** frame is transmitted unmasked (the peer still authenticates). The mask is
same-length (preserves `9=` BodyLength + the store's per-record CRC), zero-alloc (coroutine-frame copy),
and scoped to `35=A` only (the never-replayed-verbatim class). This is deliberate hardening **beyond**
reference-engine parity (QuickFIX-cpp/J FileStore persist the cleartext password). The embedded FIX `10=`
checksum of the stored frame is intentionally stale (stored frames are never re-validated as FIX nor
replayed). **Residual operator note:** the masked value length still reveals the original password length;
protect the store path with filesystem permissions and prefer mTLS identity over 553/554. *(034 FR-001..009;
`session.cpp` `store_then_emit`; witnesses `tests/session/test_credential_store_redaction.cpp`.)*

**L-034-1 — the at-rest mask relies on admin Logon frames never being replayed verbatim (forward
constraint).** The safety of masking the stored `35=A` Logon rests on the invariant that stored admin
frames are folded into a `SequenceReset-GapFill` on resend (`session.cpp` resend store-walk) and never
retransmitted byte-for-byte — so the masked stored copy can never reach the wire. **If a future feature
ever introduces verbatim admin-frame replay, it MUST re-derive the credential from configuration, not from
the (now-masked) store** — replaying the masked bytes would put `554=****` on the wire and break peer
authentication. App (non-admin) frames ARE replayed verbatim, which is precisely why 034's masking is
gated to `MsgType=A` only. *(034 R4/R7 / INV-034-3/5.)*

**L-015-5 — the deprecated `one_way_ca` TLS profile performs no peer-identity binding.** The `one_way_ca`
profile accepts any peer certificate that chains to the configured trust anchor — it does NOT bind the
certificate to a CN/SAN/CompID. (This is distinct from the default `verify_peer` path, where CompID↔TLS-
identity binding IS fully enforced per feature 015.) Operators MUST use an identity-binding profile for
production; `one_way_ca` is for transport-encryption-only / migration scenarios. *(Fable `5.1`; `src/tls/`
profile path.)*

**RELOCATED 2026-06-15** — the three Fable `5.4` 008 rows (FileStore monotone disk growth, uncapped RAM
offset index, bounded-`MemoryStore` post-cap silent resend loss) were minted out-of-band here
(2026-06-13) before 001–014 had B&L sections; the back-fill moved them into the proper
`## Message store … (008-message-store)` section above. See that section for the current text.

## 035-filestore-io-offload (2026-06-14)

**B-035-1 — `FileStore` disk I/O (`pwrite`/`fdatasync`/`rename`/`fsync`) now runs genuinely off the
session strand via `file_io_executor` (prior `[const §XV.4]` violation corrected).** From the initial
008-message-store delivery until 035-filestore-io-offload, the `FileStore::store(commit_per_message)`
path violated `[const §XV.4]` (the "no synchronous disk I/O on every send" rule): the shipped offload
idiom — `co_await asio::post(file_io_executor, use_awaitable)` — was inert (012 D-18). The `post` with
`use_awaitable` moved only the post-completion handler; the coroutine body, including the blocking
`pwrite` and `fdatasync`, resumed on the session strand and executed there synchronously. Under
`commit_per_message` this means every outbound message caused the session strand to block for the
duration of an `fdatasync` (~100 µs–10 ms on NVMe). As of **035-filestore-io-offload (PR #119)**,
all four disk-I/O sites in `FileStore` (`store()` pwrite/fdatasync, `next_seqnum()` pwrite/fdatasync,
`reset()` tmp-open/initialise/rename/parent-fsync, `flush_for_session_close()` fdatasync) run on the
`file_io_executor` thread pool via genuine `co_await asio::co_spawn(file_io_executor, syscall_lambda,
asio::use_awaitable)`. The outer `co_await` resumes on the session strand; the blocking syscalls are
pinned to the pool thread. `MemoryStore` is unaffected (zero-alloc, strand-only — unchanged). The
`FileStore` offload carries exactly one bounded O(1) `co_spawn` frame (~48 B, PMR-opaque global heap)
per disk op, permitted by the `[const §XV.1]` v0.2 §XV.4-offload exemption in `.specify/constitution.md`.
This is the project's deliberate `[const §XV.4]` async-journal posture (no strand block) — **not**
reference-engine parity: QuickFIX-cpp / QuickFIX-J perform **synchronous** FileStore flushes on the
calling thread (see `specs/035-filestore-io-offload/spec.md`); the async offload is a deliberate divergence, not a conformance
fix. [gate-b/r2 R#2: corrected PR #118→#119; replaced "parity with reference-engine behavior" with
the correct deliberate-divergence statement matching `specs/035-filestore-io-offload/spec.md`.]

`tests/session/test_file_store_offload_thread.cpp` + `test_file_store_cancellation.cpp` +
`test_file_store_concurrent_tsan.cpp`.)*

**L-035-2 — Post-rename reopen/lock failure in `FileStore::reset()` poisons the current store until
process restart.** During `reset()`, the live log is atomically replaced by a fresh log via
`rename(tmp, live)`. If the subsequent `open()`/`try_lock()` of the newly-named file fails (e.g.,
fd-limit exhaustion, permission race), the old fd names a now-unlinked inode; to avoid writing frames
that would vanish on restart, the store **fails closed**: it releases the stale fd
(`impl_->file = OsFile{}`), sets `open_ok = false`, and all further ops (`store`/`next_seqnum`/
`retrieve`/`reset`) return `store_io_failure`. The only recovery is to **restart the process**: on
restart, `FileStoreFactory::make()` reopens the now-fresh live log (the renamed file persists on
disk). Operators with aggressive fd-limit settings who observe `store_io_failure` after a session
reset should check `RLIMIT_NOFILE`. *(035 R#A.1; FR-010; `FileStore::reset()`'s post-rename reopen-fail path in `src/session/file_store.cpp`;
witness `FileStoreCancellationTest.Reset_PostRenameReopenFail_PoisonsStore_NoSilentLossAfterRestart`.)*

**L-035-3 — A `FileStore` (or any `MessageStore`) used OUTSIDE `Engine`/`Session` ownership must be quiesced by the caller before destruction; there is no public drain to call, and getting it wrong is `std::terminate()`, not an error return.** The store holds an `async_mutex`, whose destructor fires `std::terminate()` if it still has a holder or waiters (B-006-2 — a hard precondition enforced in both debug and release). `MessageStore` deliberately exposes **no** public drain entry point, so the obligation is discharged by **quiescence, not by a call**: a store method only returns after its `file_io_executor` pool work completes, and `Engine::stop()` guarantees no store `co_await` is still in flight for **Session-owned** stores — its JOIN step yields until every role loop has exited (tracked by `outstanding_counter_`) *before* the step that clears the registry and so destroys the sessions and their stores. **That guarantee does not extend to a store a consumer constructs and drives directly**, outside `Engine` ownership: `stop()` neither sees nor can drain those awaitables. Such a caller MUST (1) `co_await` every `store`/`flush` call to completion, (2) then `pool.stop()` + `pool.join()`, (3) only then destroy the store. **Status: by-design boundary** — the quiescence contract is structural, and a public drain on the store interface is deliberately not offered. *(Contract stated on `FileStore::Config` in `include/fixpp/session/file_store.hpp`; the destructor precondition it depends on is `~MessageStore() noexcept(false)` in `include/fixpp/session/message_store.hpp` and B-006-2; the Session-owned guarantee is the JOIN-before-clear ordering in `Engine::stop()`, `src/session/engine.cpp`, whose `outstanding_counter_` publication was itself TOCTOU-hardened by a Gate B round-1 finding.)*

**B-036-1 — `toAdmin` now fires for EVERY engine-originated administrative frame; `toApp` for the
engine-originated `BusinessMessageReject(35=j)`.** This amends the 019 FR-008 contract from partial
to full coverage. Which outbound engine emits invoke which `Application` callback:
- **`toAdmin` (inspect-only, not vetoable; a throw → `app_callback_threw` + Disconnected):** the
  complete engine-originated `Reject(35=3)` family — the shared `emit_session_reject_` helper
  (fromAdmin-veto + no-`Application` unknown-MsgType rejects), the established-session SendingTime
  Reject, the inbound-`SequenceReset`/`Logout` veto Rejects, the malformed-`OrigSendingTime(122)`
  Rejects (021 Arm C / RC#1 / Arm D), the `SequenceReset`-`NewSeqNo`-too-low Reject, the FIXT-1137
  Logon Reject — and **every** engine-originated `Logout(35=5)` including the initiator
  Logon-acknowledgement Guard-3 Logout (the last admin emit that previously bypassed observation).
- **`toApp` (vetoable; `app_do_not_send` → drop + stay Active + no outbound seqnum consumed; a throw
  → terminal close):** the engine-originated `BusinessMessageReject(35=j)` — `35=j` is an application
  message (outside the FIX admin set A/0/1/2/3/4/5), so it routes through `toApp`, matching
  QuickFIX-cpp/J `sendRaw`. A `toApp` veto suppresses the `35=j` but the rejected inbound message's
  durable sequence advance is **still persisted** (no restart reprocessing).
With no `Application` registered every site is a byte-for-byte no-op. *(036 FR-001..FR-008; amends

## 037-resend-reply-possdup-tags (2026-06-14)

**B-037-1 — Resend-reply `SequenceReset-GapFill(35=4, 123=Y)` now carries `PossDupFlag(43)=Y` and `OrigSendingTime(122)=SendingTime(52)`.** Every outbound GapFill emitted on a resend reply (`build_sequence_reset_gapfill`) carries exactly one `43=Y` and one `122` whose value equals the frame's own `52`. Wire-output change only; stored bytes and inbound validation are untouched. *(037 FR-001/FR-002/FR-003; `[FIX-SL §4.8.2/§4.8.5]`; `src/session/admin_messages.cpp` `build_sequence_reset_gapfill`; witness `tests/session/test_resend_reply_possdup.cpp` Cell 1.)*

**B-037-2 — Under `allow_pos_dup=true`, the auto-resend replay path now suppresses stored `43`/`122` before re-adding them, eliminating duplicate-tag emission.** When a stored application frame already carries `PossDupFlag(43)` and/or `OrigSendingTime(122)` (retained-PossDup path), `build_replay_frame` skips those stored fields before re-adding the engine-canonical `43=Y` + `122=<stored 52>` (position per the `## fixpp#419` section elsewhere in this file), so the replayed frame carries each tag exactly once. 037 did not otherwise change default-path (`allow_pos_dup=false`) replay; #419 later moved `43`/`122` into the header (B-419-1). Refines 022's retain behavior. *(037 FR-004/FR-005/FR-006; `[FIX-SL §4.8.4]`; `src/session/session.cpp` `build_replay_frame`; witnesses `tests/session/test_send_allow_pos_dup_strip.cpp` Cell 2 (retain dedup) + Cell 3 (default-path replay bytes).)*

**L-037-2 — The live QuickFIX-J acceptance arm of SC-004/FR-008 is DEFERRED to the Item-1 live-golden-capture workstream (→ G4).** The local ctest cell (`tests/interop/happy/hp_fix44_recovery_outbound_answer_test.cpp`) GTEST_SKIPs without the interop harness (`FIXPP_TLS_FIXTURE_DIR`/`INTEROP_QUICKFIX_J_PORT` unset). This is a deferral with an unblock condition (Item-1), NOT a permanent waiver — QFJ emits `43=Y` GapFills itself, so byte-level acceptance is structurally expected at capture time. Wire-level GapFill conformance is carried by Cell 1 (`tests/session/test_resend_reply_possdup.cpp`). The QuickFIX-cpp arm is separately waived per L-021-3. *(037 SC-004; deferral recorded in spec.md SC-004 disposition note + tasks.md T011.)*

## 038-acceptor-sendingtime-guard (2026-06-15)

**B-038-1 — The acceptor's first-Logon path now enforces the inbound `SendingTime(52)` MaxLatency guard (parity with the initiator Logon-ack and established-session paths).** Prior to this feature, the acceptor `NotConnected` arm admitted any inbound Logon without validating its `SendingTime(52)` — a pre-establishment blind spot absent on every other code path. An absent/empty, malformed, or stale-beyond-MaxLatency `52` on the acceptor's first inbound Logon now triggers a `Reject(35=3, 371=52, 373=10)` + disconnect (no Logout — pre-establishment shape, matching the in-arm `1137` sibling; QuickFIX emits a Logout first, a documented divergence). The conforming path is byte-for-byte identical to pre-feature behaviour. The guard is inserted AFTER `ensure_hydrated_` (so the outbound `Reject` carries the hydrated durable outbound seqnum `N`) and BEFORE `reset_on_logon`/`check_inbound` (so a rejected Logon does NOT advance or persist the inbound counter). *(038 FR-001..FR-005, SC-001..SC-003; `[FIX-SL §4.2.3]`; amends S-019; `src/session/session.cpp` acceptor `NotConnected` arm; witnesses `tests/session/test_acceptor_logon_sending_time.cpp` cells 1–14.)*

**L-038-1 — Absent or empty `SendingTime(52)` on the acceptor first-Logon is rejected with `SessionRejectReason=10` (SendingTimeAccuracyProblem), not `RequiredTagMissing=1`.** QuickFIX-cpp and QuickFIX-J disposition a missing `52` field as `RequiredTagMissing(1)`. fixpp uses `reason=10` (SendingTimeAccuracyProblem) for absent, empty, malformed, AND stale — a documented divergence in favour of internal consistency with the existing established-session path (which already maps empty `52` → `reason=10`). Operators interoperating with strict `RequiredTagMissing`-discriminating counterparties should note the difference. **Status: wontfix** (intentional, grounded in the spec.md Clarifications 2026-06-14 `reason=10` decision). *(038 FR-003; `[FIX-SL §4.2.3]`; `src/session/session.cpp`.)*

**L-038-2 — The acceptor first-Logon `SendingTime` reject shape is Reject + disconnect with NO Logout (diverges from QuickFIX's Logout-first shape); a dedicated LIVE bad-`SendingTime` cross-engine interop witness is DEFERRED.** fixpp's pre-establishment reject (absent/malformed/stale `52`) emits `Reject(35=3)` → `Disconnected`, mirroring the in-arm `1137` reject (live-proven vs QFcpp/QFJ in 033) and NOT the established-session Q3 path (which emits Logout first, as it is tearing down a live session). QuickFIX-cpp/QFJ `doBadTime` emit a Logout-with-text before disconnecting. This shape divergence is intentional and consistent with fixpp's own pre-establishment reject contract. A live bad-`SendingTime` cross-engine interop witness with QuickFIX-cpp and QuickFIX-J is DEFERRED to the L-021-3/L-037-2 live-interop family. **Status: deferred** (live interop witness conditioned on the Item-1 live-golden workstream; unit-level shape conformance is carried by `tests/session/test_acceptor_logon_sending_time.cpp` cells 1–9). *(038 FR-002; spec.md Clarifications 2026-06-14; `src/session/session.cpp`.)*

**L-038-3 — Benign, self-healing outbound-seqnum asymmetry under `reset_on_logon` when `52`-guard and `1137`-reject fire in sequence (Gate-A round-3 note).** When `reset_on_logon` is configured, the `52`-guard fires AFTER `ensure_hydrated_` (which seeds the outbound counter to the durable value `N`) but BEFORE the `reset_on_logon` block (which resets the outbound counter to 1). A first-Logon rejected by the `52`-guard emits a `Reject` carrying the hydrated outbound seqnum `N`, then disconnects; the `reset_on_logon` block (which would have reset the counter) is never reached, so the in-memory outbound counter remains at `N`. If the next attempt arrives with a conforming `52`, `reset_on_logon` fires and resets the counter to 1 before the Logon is processed — no net divergence. A `1137`-reject on the FIXT path has the same shape for the same reason. This asymmetry is self-healing across retry attempts and is not observable to a well-behaved counterparty (the interim state is never used to emit further frames). **Status: wontfix** (self-healing, documented, no operator action required). *(038 Gate-A round-3 commentary; `src/session/session.cpp` ordering of `ensure_hydrated_` / `52`-guard / `reset_on_logon`.)*

**G2 note — `ReconnectFsm` `credentials_rotated` callback-boundary seam hardened (2026-06-15).** The single `emit_credentials_rotated_()` call in `reconnect_fsm.cpp` is now wrapped in `try { … } catch (...) { /* contain — notification is best-effort */ }`, matching the established `authorize_logon` callback-guard shape. On the live `Session` path the callback is engine-owned and `noexcept` (a ring-buffer emit invoking no user code), so a throw is **unreachable in production**; the guard hardens the standalone-FSM injection seam. The catch falls through to the `last_active_source_`/`last_active_fp_` baseline update and the remaining attempt steps (`make()` → handshake) — the attempt is not aborted. *(038 FR-006/FR-007; `src/session/reconnect_fsm.cpp`; witness `tests/session/test_credentials_rotated_emit.cpp`.)*

**B-040-1 — All live-inbound hand-rolled FIX tag scanners are now bounded against forged-tag overflow aliasing; one of them shipped a defective guard that is now fixed.** A forged multi-digit tag token (e.g. `429496729649`) overflows the `uint32_t` tag accumulator used by the engine's hand-rolled SOH field scanners and **wraps to a small value, aliasing a security-relevant tag** (34 MsgSeqNum, 49/56 CompID, 52 SendingTime, 1137 DefaultApplVerID). 040 routes **all five** live-inbound scanners — `OffsetTable::build` (Index), `field_iterator::advance` (Scan), `interpret_logon`, `scan_first_frame_ids`, and `scan_frame_header` — through one shared `constexpr` in-loop `0xFFFF`-bound helper (`fixpp::wire::accumulate_tag_digit`, defined in `include/fixpp/wire/tag_scan.hpp`); each keeps its existing disposition (the forged field is skipped/rejected and never surfaced under the aliased tag). The most central scanner, `scan_frame_header` (every inbound frame's header), had **shipped a defective `>429496729U` guard** that admitted wrap-and-continue tokens — including 52-aliasing, a regression vector against the 038 SendingTime guard — now fixed. The threat is **bounded to a TLS-authenticated, CompID-bound counterparty (015)** — no anonymous MITM (MED severity). `build_replay_frame` (which parses our own stored outbound replay frames, not inbound bytes) is a **justified exclusion** — not a forged-tag vector. The two anon-namespace session scanners were extracted to `fixpp::session::detail` headers (`scan_frame_header.hpp`, `scan_first_frame_ids.hpp`; `msgtype_classifier.hpp` pattern) for direct unit testing. A live cross-engine bad-tag interop witness is DEFERRED to the Item-1 live-golden workstream (L-038-2 / L-021-3 family). *(040 FR-001..FR-009, SC-001..SC-005; `include/fixpp/wire/tag_scan.hpp` + the 5 scanner sites; witnesses `tests/wire/tag_scan_test.cpp` + `*_overflow_test.cpp` × 5.)*

## 041-validation-gate-wiring (2026-06-16)

**B-041-1 — Opt-in dictionary-driven inbound validation is now wired into the live session path (default OFF), resolving the B-004-1 / B-005-7 unwired-validator gap under strict mode.** A new per-session flag `SessionConfig::validate_inbound_messages` (default `false`) enables the previously-dead `wire::dictionary_driven_validator` on the inbound path. When enabled, every inbound message processed in the `NotConnected`/`LogonSent`/`LogonReceived`/`Active` FSM states (including the establishing Logon) is validated against the session dictionary **before that arm's sequence-number gate** — and, in the Logon-bearing arms, **before `interpret_logon()`** (validate-first) — for: standard-header field order, undefined tags, required-field presence, field-value type conformance, and repeating-group structure. A violation emits `Reject(35=3)` with `SessionRejectReason ∈ {14 header-out-of-order, 2 unexpected-tag, 1 required-missing/group-structure, 5 type-nonconformant, 6 Float precision-loss (see L-041-3)}`. In `LogonReceived`/`Active` a rejected message at the expected inbound seqnum consumes it and any other does not (B-423-1; fixpp#423 supersedes this row's earlier "does not advance seqnum"). The `LogoutSent`/`Disconnected` drain states are excluded, and the existing `Reject(35=3)`/`Logout(35=5)` no-reject-loop exemption is preserved. At default (flag `false`) the validator is never constructed and the early `MessageView` parse never runs — byte-identical to the prior release (FR-002/SC-005, witnessed by `has_validator_for_test()==false`). *(041 FR-001..FR-006/FR-009..FR-011, SC-001..SC-003/SC-005; `[2b §6.5]`; `[FIX50SP2 §2.1]` for 373; supersedes the "UNWIRED / [RATIFY]" status of B-004-1 / B-005-7 under opt-in; `include/fixpp/dict/{field_type,table_view}.hpp`, `Dictionary::as_table_view()`, `src/session/session.cpp` `on_inbound_frame`; witnesses `tests/session/test_validate_gate_{inbound,logon_arm,default_off}.cpp`.)*

**B-041-2 — The Engine clock-config gate is now wired: `Engine::start()` returns `expected_t<void>` and rejects a null time source with `clock_not_set`, resolving B-007-2.** `Engine::start()` changed from `void` to `[[nodiscard]] core::expected_t<void>` and calls `validate_engine_config()` at entry, returning `clock_not_set` (`core::error` slot 54) before any session loop is spawned when `EngineConfig::clock == nullptr`. The gate is unconditional (not configurable — FR-008): a null clock is always invalid. Zero production callers existed (no C-ABI wrapper), so the only public-API impact is the return-type change. A valid clock starts and operates unchanged (FR-009). Note: activating a real engine clock also activates the session-level `SendingTime(52)` MaxLatency guard that is inert under a null clock — test frame builders feeding live sessions must stamp `52` (the 038 pattern). *(041 FR-007/FR-008, SC-004; `[2d §4.4]`; supersedes B-007-2 "UNWIRED" status; `include/fixpp/session/engine.hpp`, `src/session/engine.cpp`; witness `tests/session/test_engine_clock_gate.cpp`.)*

**L-041-1 — [RETIRED by 075-live-wire-enum-validation (2026-07-14) — this is precisely what 075 delivers. `table_view::enum_valid()` is a real dictionary-driven domain check across all ten supported dictionaries; see `## 075-live-wire-enum-validation` below (B-075-1, L-075-1). The historical Phase-1 text is retained for context, NOT current behavior.] Enum-value conformance is NOT validated even with strict validation enabled (deferred to the 2c enum-table work).** The production `table_view::enum_valid()` returns `true` unconditionally (Phase-1) because `FieldRef::enum_table_index` is a reserved-but-unbacked slot — no enum-value tables exist yet. A field whose value is a wrong enum constant but a correct type is **accepted** under strict mode. This is the one validator input (of six) the production dictionary cannot yet feed. **Status: deferred** (2c enum tables → back `enum_table_index` → flip `enum_valid` real). *(041 FR-005; `field_ref.hpp` `enum_table_index`; supersedes part of L-003-3.)*

**L-041-2 — FIXT application-message validation uses the session dictionary only; full two-dictionary resolution (application dictionary by `DefaultApplVerID`) is deferred.** QuickFIX validates a FIXT application message against BOTH the session (FIXT.1.1 transport/admin) dictionary AND a separate application dictionary resolved from `DefaultApplVerID` (`Session.cpp:1218-1229`). Phase-1 validates against the session-held `cfg.dictionary` only; for a FIXT session the session dictionary is FIXT.1.1, so validating an application message against it would over-reject. Therefore application-message validation parity for FIXT sessions is out of scope this feature. **Status: deferred — tracked as issue #203** (promoted 2026-07-18 during feature 079/fixpp#201, which re-surfaced this: the vendored FIX50SPx application dicts ship an empty `<header/>`, so a standalone full-frame `validate()` rejects a FIX50SPx application message on tag 8 before the required-field scan; 079 scopes its FIX50SP2 correctness to the header-independent derivation/census tier). **RESOLUTION — the #203 tag-8-reject sub-part is FIXED by 081-strict-validation-residuals (2026-07-19, Concern A):** on the opt-in strict path, `Dictionary::as_table_view()` populates a **validator-private FIXT framing surface** (the full vendored `FIXT11.xml` `<header>`+`<trailer>` tag→datatype set, incl. the nested `NoHops` hop tags 627/628/629/630) for the empty-`<header/>` versions {v50, v50sp1, v50sp2}, so `validate()` **accepts** the FIXT-owned header/trailer tags (no tag-8 reject) and type-checks them. **NAMED-INTENT divergence from QuickFIX (deliberate, not a latent surprise):** the resolution is **accept-only** — unlike QuickFIX (which validates the FIXT header's *required* fields against the session dict), fixpp's dictionary validator does **not** enforce header-field required-presence; the session-layer FSM owns SeqNum/CompID presence (the `/clarify` accept-only decision). The broader `L-041-2` claim (full two-dictionary resolution of a separate application dictionary by `DefaultApplVerID`, QuickFIX `Session.cpp:1218`) remains deliberately **out of scope** — 081 delivers the observable acceptance via a merged validation view, not session/version resolution plumbing. A future per-release QuickFIX interop parity pass should treat the header-required divergence as recorded intent, not a re-filed bug. *(041 Clarifications 2026-06-16; Out-of-Scope; #203 cross-ref added 2026-07-18; #203 tag-8 sub-part resolved by 081 Concern A 2026-07-19.)*

**L-041-3 — `SessionRejectReason=6` (incorrect data format, the `wire_field_value_truncated` arm) is structurally UNREACHABLE with the default `FIXPP_DECIMAL_T = pod_decimal`; it is a forward-looking guard for fixed-precision decimal traits.** The validator's Float type arm maps a `decimal_precision_loss` parse error to `wire_field_value_truncated` → reason 6. But `decimal_precision_loss` is produced **only** at the cross-traits conversion boundary (`decimal<T>::from<U>()`/`to<U>()` in `include/fixpp/core/decimal.hpp`, remapping `decimal_overflow`→`decimal_precision_loss` for `T≠U`); the validator calls single-traits `decimal_t::parse` (= `pod_decimal::from_chars`), which returns only `decimal_invalid_input` / `decimal_overflow`, never `decimal_precision_loss`. Both of those now remap to `wire_field_value_out_of_range` → **reason 5** (the T009a remap closing the non-`wire_*` leak). So with the default `pod_decimal`, a malformed/overflowing Float yields reason **5**, and reason **6** is never emitted on the session path. The reason-6 map entry + the validator's `decimal_precision_loss` arm are retained as forward-looking guards for an alternate `FIXPP_DECIMAL_T` whose `parse` yields precision-loss. **Status: wontfix** (forward-looking guard; SC-003's reason-6 sub-claim is waived-with-proof in the 041 completeness audit). *(041 FR-004/SC-003; `include/fixpp/wire/validator.hpp` Float arm + `reject_reason_map.hpp`; the `decimal_overflow` → `decimal_precision_loss` remap in `include/fixpp/core/decimal.hpp`.)*

## 043-plaintext-tcp-transport (2026-06-17)

### Behaviors

**B-043-1 — Inbound `EncryptMethod(98)≠0` is now enforced on every session (all profiles, not just plaintext).** Prior to this feature, `interpret_logon` silently skipped tag 98 on inbound Logon (S-021 "inbound 98≠0 not handled"; TC-017 gap). 043 T030 adds an explicit scan: a received `98` field that is present but not equal to `"0"` causes `interpret_logon` to return `session_invalid_logon` — the Logon is rejected before any sequence-number or profile check. A present-but-malformed `98` (non-numeric, empty, etc.) fails closed the same way. This is **unconditional across all SecurityProfile kinds** — `interpret_logon` is profile-agnostic. The existing outbound `98=0` emit (`build_logon`) is unchanged. *(043 T030; `[const §XII.7]`; `src/session/admin_messages.cpp` `interpret_logon`; witness `tests/session/test_interpret_logon_encrypt_method.cpp` — 4 cells, mutation-tested.)*

### Limitations

**L-043-1 — `insecure_plain_tcp` provides NO peer authentication.** When `SecurityProfile::kind::insecure_plain_tcp` is configured, the TLS handshake is skipped entirely: no peer certificate is presented, verified, or captured. As a result: (1) `CompIdAuthorizationPolicy::authorize_logon` is NOT called at Logon time (the CompID↔TLS-identity binding from 015 is TLS-only); (2) `live_peer_id_` remains `nullopt` for the session's lifetime — `last_live_peer_identity()` returns empty; (3) `session_event_tls_validation_failed` is never emitted (no TLS handshake to fail). The existing 028-era `check_comp_id` (49/56 matching) is **still enforced** — only the TLS-identity layer is absent. Operators MUST ensure link-level security (colocation cross-connect, VPN/IPsec) before using `insecure_plain_tcp`. **Status: wontfix** (by design — plaintext transport intentionally omits TLS-layer auth; the `[[deprecated]]` friction at the selection site is the construction-time warning). *(043 FR-008a, D-10; `src/session/session.cpp` `install_reconnected_transport` / `attach_accepted_transport`; witness `tests/session/test_session_plaintext_authz.cpp`.)*

**L-043-2 — Plaintext accepted transports receive no TLS-validation event hooks.** A `SecurityProfile::kind::insecure_plain_tcp` acceptor session does NOT emit `session_event_tls_validation_failed`, does NOT call `set_listener_events` with TLS validation callbacks, and returns no `handshake_result` peer-identity — those hooks are TLS-only. An operator registering a `tls_validation_failed` listener on a plaintext session's `SessionEvents` will receive zero events. **Status: wontfix** (by design — there is no TLS handshake on a plaintext transport). *(043 E-7, D-10; `src/session/engine.cpp` `run_accept_loop`; witness `tests/session/test_session_plaintext_authz.cpp`.)*

## Performance characteristics — phase-9 cross-engine benchmarking (2026-06-19)

> Cross-cutting (not a single feature). The figures below are **indicative, not publishable** — measured on WSL2 without core isolation, so *relative ordering* is sound but *absolute magnitudes* are not. Method + full data: parent `phases/phase-9/materiality-assessment.md` and `phase-9-harness/COMPARISON-fixpp-vs-quickfix.md`. Governed by `[const §VIII §2]` (session throughput parity-or-better with QuickFIX; latency measured/reported, no constitutional absolute).

### Behaviors

**B-PERF-1 — fixpp is competitive on the steady-state message path and dominates connection establishment.** Indicative depth-1 request→response latency sits between the mature native engine and the JVM engine (fixpp p50 ~423µs; QuickFIX-cpp ~349µs; QuickFIX-J ~569µs), and connection establishment is 4–33× faster than both QuickFIX engines. A throwaway multi-session scaling probe showed a single io_context worker sustains ~16k msg/s aggregate across 32 concurrent self-paired sessions with bounded p99 (~2.4ms) — ample for the target market's scale. *(phase-9 `COMPARISON-fixpp-vs-quickfix.md` + `materiality-assessment.md` §8; `[const §VIII §2]`.)*

### Limitations

**L-PERF-1 — Under deep single-session pipelining, burst-tail latency degrades ~2.4× vs QuickFIX-cpp.** With many messages in flight on ONE session (in-flight depth 64–256), fixpp's p99/p99.9 tail is ~2.4× QuickFIX-cpp's (≈ on par with QuickFIX-J's); **throughput stays at parity** (~3% of QFcpp). The cause is architectural: the engine multiplexes all session strands on a single `io_context` (vs QuickFIX's per-session OS threads), so one deeply-pipelined session cannot spread its in-flight work across cores. The depth-1 majority path (order→ack / quote / cancel) is unaffected and competitive (B-PERF-1). **Status: known limitation — tracked v1.1 candidate** (product disposition 2026-06-19, materiality "PARTIAL/HEDGE": NOT a v1.0 release gate; revisited post-v1.0 only if a burst-sensitive use case — market-making / mass-quote — materializes). The per-session-executor threading-model change that would close it is an invasive public-API change, deliberately out of the v1.0 critical path. NOTE: the per-dispatch executor-allocation optimization is NOT the lever (a partial mitigation only; the lever is the threading model). *(phase-9 `materiality-assessment.md` §2/§7/§8; root cause in `phases/phase-9/benchmark-readiness.md` + hot-path profiling `/tmp/perf-out/FINDINGS.md`.)*

## 044-toml-session-config (2026-06-19)

### Behaviors

**B-044-1 — RESOLVED (T039, PR #140): tomlplusplus 3.4.0 aborted or invoked undefined behaviour on certain malformed TOML table headers, bypassing the loader's `noexcept` boundary.** The loader wraps the tomlplusplus parse call in a `try/catch(...)`, which is sufficient for normal parse errors. However, `TOML_ASSERT_ASSUME(...)` inside the parser's `parse_key()` method fires `assert()` → `abort()` (debug/ASan builds) or `__builtin_assume(false)` → UB (release/NDEBUG builds) on attacker-controlled malformed input such as `[ [key]]` (space before the second `[`). In the debug/ASan path `abort()` is not a C++ exception and therefore escapes the `try/catch`, violating FR-012 rule-9 (the central guarantee that every input yields either a `ConfigBundle` or a vector of diagnostics, never a fatal signal). In the release path `__builtin_assume(false)` is UB. Reproducer: `tests/config/fuzz/crashes/repro_toml_assert_assume.toml`. A fuzzer-discovered defect (T037 libFuzzer harness). **Status: RESOLVED 2026-06-20 (T039, PR #140).** Fixed with `src/config/toml_include.hpp` — a single ODR-safe shim that, across the tomlplusplus include, saves & `#undef`s `NDEBUG` (so the overridable `TOML_ASSERT` path stays active in all build modes) and redefines `TOML_ASSERT` to THROW a catchable `std::logic_error` that unwinds into the loader's existing `catch` as a `parse_error` diagnostic. All config TUs route tomlplusplus through the shim (ODR). Validated RED→GREEN on the reproducer in BOTH asan/Debug and release/NDEBUG, plus a ≥10-min ASan fuzz from the seeded corpus in both build modes with zero crashes. *(044 T037/T039; FR-012 rule-9; `src/config/toml_include.hpp`; `tests/config/fuzz/crashes/repro_toml_assert_assume.toml`.)*

### Limitations

**L-044-1 — `reject_policy` is file-recognized but not file-selectable (step-1 capability limit).** `SessionConfig::reject_policy` is a recognized field in the loader's scalar mapper, but the underlying `RejectPolicy` enum (owned by feature 005) is **forward-declared only with no enumerators defined in this checkout** — no canonical token can be mapped from a string. A TOML file containing a `reject_policy` key resolves to `recognized_not_yet_supported_step2` (not `unknown_key`) so that the diagnostic is informative rather than misleading. The programmatic path to `reject_policy` is unaffected (host-built `SessionConfig` sets it directly). **Status: step-1 capability limit — resolved when feature 005 lands the `RejectPolicy` enum enumerators.** *(044 data-model E-6; `src/config/scalar_mappers.cpp`; `neg_multi.toml` negative battery fixture.)*

**L-044-2 — A missing `security_profile.kind` produces both a primary `missing_required` diagnostic AND a redundant resolver-layer `invalid_or_contradictory_selector` diagnostic.** The loader runs validation (which emits `missing_required` at `session[0].security_profile.kind`) and selector resolution (which also attempts to build the transport selector and emits `invalid_or_contradictory_selector` at `…transport` because no security-profile kind was provided) as independent passes in collect-ALL mode. Both diagnostics describe the same root cause; the second is redundant but not incorrect. An optional cleanup — suppressing the resolver arm when `security_profile.kind` is absent — would yield a single-diagnostic result for this input. **Status: known / low-priority — redundant but not contradictory; optional cleanup tracked in tasks.md T033 notes.** *(044 data-model E-3; `src/config/selector_resolver.cpp`; witnessed in the US2 negative battery.)*

## 045-observability-config (logging leg, 2026-06-20)

Extends the 044 loader to hydrate the existing `fixpp::log::Logger` (file / syslog / OTLP-log sinks) from `[logger]` / `[[logger.sinks]]`. One additive `shared_ptr<Logger>` field on `EngineEstablishment` (host wires it onto `EngineConfig::logger`); per-session via the existing `SessionConfig::logger_override`. No new dependency / public type / `reason_class` / `fixpp_error_t` / wire / codegen / C-ABI. Catalogue **T-044** (design row).

**B-045-1 — `[default.logger]` is inherited as a per-session `logger_override` by every session that has no explicit `[session.logger]` (MERGED semantics, user-ratified 2026-06-20).** The per-session logger is resolved from the *merged* session table (`[default]` deep-merged under each `[[session]]`), consistent with how `[default]` supplies every other session field. Consequence: when a file authors `[default.logger]`, each session without its own `[session.logger]` gets a distinct logger constructed from the default block, and the engine-level `[logger]` is shadowed for those sessions. Spec AC US3-2 ("a session that does not override it inherits the engine default — null override") describes only the no-`[default.logger]` case and is unaffected. The alternative (RAW — only an explicit `[session.logger]` creates an override) was rejected because it would silently ignore a recognized `[default.logger]`. *(045 US3 / data-model E-5; `src/config/toml_config_loader.cpp`; witnessed in `test_load_logger_overrides.cpp`.)*

**B-045-2 — The loader rejects an empty OTLP `endpoint` (`empty_required`) rather than silently dropping the sink.** The runtime `OtlpLogSink` treats an empty endpoint as a silent no-op (drops export); the loader is deliberately STRICTER and fails closed at load with `empty_required` on `logger.sinks[N].endpoint`, so a typo'd/blank endpoint is loud at config time rather than a silent telemetry hole. *(045 spec Edge Cases / FR-014; `src/config/logger_resolver.cpp`.)*

**L-045-1 — Inherited-017 preflight→construct TOCTOU: a sink whose `open()` fails AFTER the load-time preflight is silently disabled by the `Logger` constructor.** The loader's fail-closed guarantee ("nothing opened on a failed load") rests on a side-effect-free load-time resource preflight (file-sink directory exists + writable [stat/access only], OTLP cert readable + PEM-magic, endpoint non-empty) followed by live `Logger` construction ONLY on a clean whole-file accumulator. The `Logger` constructor (017) opens every sink and **silently disables (and counts) any sink whose `open()` fails** — so a narrow time-of-check/time-of-use window remains between the preflight and construction (e.g. the directory is removed, or the cert becomes unreadable, in that window). This is the inherited 017 logger contract, unchanged here; a future tightening could read the post-construction sink-error counters and fail closed. **Status: named, bounded inherited limitation.** *(045 research D-7 / spec FR-014/FR-015; `src/config/logger_resolver.cpp` `construct_loggers_if_clean`; `src/log/logger.cpp`.)*

**L-045-3 — `FileSink` has three drain-side loss paths that increment NO counter, so `drop_count()` is a floor on records lost, not a total.** The producer-side accounting is exact (`drop_count()` / `timeout_drop_count()` / `filter_count()` are separate and complete for records the *ring* discards — FR-003/FR-004). What is NOT counted is loss inside the sink, after a record was successfully dequeued: (1) `rotate()` falls through to `std::fopen(live_path_, "wb")` — **truncating** — when the `std::filesystem::rename` of the live file fails, so the un-archived records in that file are gone; (2) `emit()` accumulates `bytes_written_` only under `if (written > 0)`, so a **short `fwrite`** loses bytes and reports nothing; (3) `emit()` early-returns on `stream_ == nullptr`, which is the state a failed rotation leaves behind, so every subsequent record is discarded silently. All three are swallowed by the enclosing `catch (...)` in `emit()`/`rotate()` and none touches `sink_error_counts_` (that counter is fed only by exceptions escaping `Sink::emit`/`flush` into the drain loop — these paths never escape). **Operator consequence:** on a healthy filesystem none of these fire, but `surviving + drop_count() + timeout_drop_count() == enqueued` is not an invariant you may rely on for audit; treat a shortfall as possible sink-side loss rather than as a drop-accounting defect. **Detection:** one rotation produces exactly one archive when `max_keep_count` is not exceeded, so `rotation_count() != <archive count>` is the cheap signal that path (1) fired. **Status: named, uninstrumented; a future tightening would give the sink its own loss counter.** *(#211; `src/log/file_sink.cpp` `emit`/`rotate`; derived from source and exercised by the short-write mutant in `ci/red-arms/filesink-join-and-backpressure.sh` arm 3, which the integrity assertion in `tests/log/test_file_sink_backpressure.cpp` reports as malformed lines. The test asserts `<=` and gates the exact equality behind the archive-count witness for exactly this reason.)*

**L-045-2 — Syslog sink + the file-sink writability *preflight* are POSIX-only (FileSink itself is now cross-platform).** `kind="syslog"` resolves to a real `SyslogSink` only on a build where `<syslog.h>` is present (`FIXPP_HAS_SYSLOG`, POSIX); on a non-POSIX build it fails closed with `invalid_or_contradictory_selector` (loud, never silently skipped — FR-013). **SyslogSink cannot be ported** — Windows has no syslog API (its equivalent is the Event Log, a different model); on Windows, use `FileSink` (local disk) or `OtlpLogSink` (remote collector). The file-sink directory-writability *preflight* still uses POSIX `::access(W_OK)`, guarded `#ifndef _WIN32`, so on Windows that load-time sub-check is skipped. **Update (2026-06-22, the Tier-2 Windows enablement): `FileSink` is now a single cross-platform implementation** — `std::fopen`/`std::fwrite` + a platform durability shim (`::fdatasync` POSIX / `::_commit` Windows) and `::fileno`/`::_fileno` (`src/log/file_sink.cpp`); binary mode keeps `\n` line endings and byte-exact accounting on both. So Windows DOES have local-disk logging now; only the *writability preflight* remains POSIX-only. If a non-writable directory is reached at runtime on either platform, it degrades to the named [[L-045-1]] limitation (`FileSink::open()` → `log_sink_open_failed` → the `Logger` ctor disables **and counts** the sink via `sink_error_counts_`, not a silent fail-open). A portable Windows writability probe (`_waccess`) is the only remaining deferral. **Status: SyslogSink POSIX-only by design (un-portable); FileSink cross-platform; Windows `::access` writability preflight deferred.** *(045 FR-013/FR-014 + Tier-2 Windows port; `src/config/logger_resolver.cpp`, `src/log/file_sink.cpp`; witnessed `SyslogBuildConditional` in `test_load_logger_negative.cpp` + the 6 `tests/log/test_file_sink_*` tests.)*

## 048-async-mutex-strand-reap (strand-local drain simplification, 2026-06-22)

Supersedes the unmerged 047 converging-loop approach (PR #143 to be closed). 047's `async_mutex` B&L
entries never reached `main`, so there is nothing to supersede here; this section is the canonical
record. Amends NFR-016. Branched off `main`; 046 (PR #142) rebases on this. Design: `.specify/2f-async-mutex.md`
Erratum **E-5**; `specs/048-async-mutex-strand-reap/`.

### Behaviors

**B-048-1 — `cancel_and_drain()` is a synchronous strand-local single-pass reap with a strand-local quiescence loop; it converges on every begun acquirer/holder/parked-waiter under the SUPPORTED (strand-serialized) topology, by construction.** The reaper sets `draining_`, then loops: reap both lists (`state_` LIFO + `next_drain_head_` FIFO; each parked waiter CAS `queued→cancelled`, `result_=unexpected{sync_lock_aborted}`, posted resume via `schedule_record_resume` which is the sole `in_flight_resumers_` incrementer), breaking only when `active_holders_count_==0 ∧ in_flight_resumers_==0 ∧ both lists empty in one pass`, else `co_await asio::post(executor)` to let a pre-drain holder's `unlock()` and the posted resumers run; finalize CAS `state_ locked_no_waiters→not_locked` then `draining_complete_` (release). The cross-thread "convergence" machinery (the `drain_latch_state`/`concurrent_channel` latch, `signal_release`/`signal_abort`/`async_wait`, the `active_acquirers_count_` epoch, the `draining_`↔counter handshake, the reaper cancel-slot + abort path) is REMOVED — it existed only to wait on OTHER threads, and the drain is contractually strand-confined. The residual multi-threaded orphan that the 047 converging-loop left (047 W-B1, 3/25 standalone) is eliminated by construction. A reentrant `cancel_and_drain()` on the strand AWAITS `draining_complete_` and returns the terminal result (never eager-ok). The drain is UNINTERRUPTIBLE (disables its own cancellation; no `sync_lock_aborted` drain return). Reaped/parked waiters keep `sync_lock_aborted`; new post-`draining_` acquirers keep `sync_lock_drained` (no observable result-code change, FR-007). Witnessed: `sync_drain_strand_local_reap` (SC-001 stress, self-deadline), `sync_drain_immediate_destroy` (no immediate-destroy UAF — `in_flight_resumers_==0` barrier), `sync_drain_reentrant_during_active`, `sync_drain_onstrand_cancel` (single-winner CAS), `sync_drain_predrain_holder`, `sync_drain_awaitable_cancellation` (uninterruptibility) — all GREEN debug + ASan + TSan-libstdc++. *(048 FR-001/002/004/005/007; `include/fixpp/core/sync/async_mutex.hpp`; `.specify/2f-async-mutex.md` E-5.)*

**B-048-2 — `async_lock()` lock-setup `inherited_slot.assign` fails closed (`sync_lock_alloc_failed`) instead of `std::terminate()` under OOM.** asio `cancellation_slot::assign` allocates the handler closure and can throw `bad_alloc`; escaping the `noexcept` `await_suspend` would terminate the process (killing all sessions). The site is wrapped in a `try/catch(...)` that, since the handler is already moved into the awaiter, completes via the POSTED runner with `unexpected{sync_lock_alloc_failed}` (exact ref-balance mirrors the shipped `store_executor` fail-close exit + the `draining_` branch). `reaper_slot.assign` is eliminated with the reaper park. Witnessed structurally + by the live `sync_pmr_fallback` sibling (the `store_executor` fail-close path: PMR exhausted → `sync_lock_alloc_failed`, no terminate). *(048 FR-003; `async_mutex.hpp` `async_lock`.)*

### Limitations

**L-048-1 — `async_lock`'s resumption `asio::post` and the drain holder-yield `asio::post` remain pre-existing OOM-terminate sites (deferred non-allocating-completion redesign).** Both posts sit inside `noexcept` contexts; on `bad_alloc` they `std::terminate()`. The resume post (`async_mutex.hpp` `resume_fn_`) is PRE-EXISTING on `main` (shipped behavior, unchanged by 048); the drain holder-yield post REPLACES the shipped `drain_latch_state::async_wait` allocation (same OOM-terminate class, not a net-new exposure). A non-allocating (pre-reserved / associated-allocator) completion redesign was evaluated at Gate A and DROPPED as unproven (no asio preflight seam — Gate-A P2-1; cf. E-4 `cancellation_slot` has no allocator hook); deferred. Same class/treatment as 047's L-047-2. OOM-only marginal degradation (process-wide exhaustion imminent). **Status: deferred known limitation.** *(048 D-3 / FR-003; `async_mutex.hpp` `resume_fn_` + the `cancel_and_drain` yield.)*

**L-048-2 — Genuinely-concurrent (non-strand-serialized) `cancel_and_drain()` overlap is UNSUPPORTED / UNDEFINED, documentation-enforced (no production assertion seam).** The drain contract is narrowed to the strand-serialized topology (the only one the production consumers use — 2 drain consumers, both on the session strand). Ordinary cross-thread `async_lock`/`unlock` contention stays SUPPORTED (the §1.1 cross-domain seam); ONLY drain-overlap is narrowed. A consumer that drives a concurrent drain via a `direct_executor` that attests-but-violates serialization (INV-2) is UNDEFINED. `async_mutex` stores no executor, so there is no cheap production assertion seam (Gate-A P2-4); the contract is documentation-enforced (FR-006 demoted to documentation-primary). **Status: documented unsupported topology.** *(048 FR-006 / contract §Unsupported; `async_mutex.hpp` `cancel_and_drain` doc-comment.)*

## 049-c-abi-handles-errors (C ABI Feature A — handles, error surface, version, 2026-06-23)

Foundation C-ABI surface (CA-001..004): the opaque-handle catalogue, the full bounded
`fixpp_error_t` master enum + `fixpp_strerror`, the per-symbol reentrancy contract, and the
runtime version accessors + macros. ABI-affecting; all four Article X §6 controls applied
(Gate A converged r3). Spec: `specs/049-c-abi-handles-errors/`. C-ABI version 0.1.0→0.2.0
(stays pre-1.0; GA does the 0→1 freeze).

### Behaviors

**B-049-1 — `translate(fixpp::core::error)` is a total, audited coalescing switch (116 enumerators → published `fixpp_error_t`), engine-internal; only `fixpp_strerror`/`fixpp_version`/`fixpp_library_version` cross the boundary.** The switch has NO `default` (`-Wswitch` enforces totality over all 116 enumerators); per-arm coalescing is the audited data-model E-3 decision, locked by a checked-in correctness oracle (`tests/capi/expected_error_map.csv` driven through `translate()`, mutation-tested — flipping one arm goes RED). `fixpp_strerror` returns a pointer into static storage (same pointer on repeat call, zero-alloc); out-of-range/undefined/reserved → `"unknown error"`. The provisional decimal codes were renumbered into their `[2i §4.3]` master blocks (`BUFFER_TOO_SMALL` 3→6, `DECIMAL_INVALID` 10→800, `DECIMAL_PRECISION_LOSS` 11→801); `src/capi/decimal.cpp` routes through the shared `translate()`; references are by macro name so the change is value-transparent. Exported surface is `fixpp_*`-only (0 C++ leak, nm gate); `fixpp_version()`={0,2,0}, `fixpp_library_version()`={0,0,1} (decoupled tracks). Occupancy gate (`tools/check_capi_occupancy.sh`, Check A header layout + Check B source-domain counts, never compared) + discrete reentrancy gate (`tools/check_capi_reentrancy.sh`, exactly-one class per exported symbol's doc-block) wired into Tier-1. *(049 FR-006..014/017; `include/fix/c_api/{error,version,handles,export}.h`, `src/capi/{error,version}.cpp`.)*

### Limitations

**L-049-1 — the forward-compat error downgrade (`translate_for_consumer`) is implemented as a pure function but is NOT yet wired to a live `consumer_minor`.** All current codes carry `introducing_minor=2`; the downgrade (`introducing_minor > consumer_minor → FIXPP_ERR_UNKNOWN`) is unit-tested directly (consumer_minor=1 downgrades all minor-2 codes; consumer_minor≥2 passes through), but the point that *records* `consumer_minor` — `fixpp_engine_create` — is Feature B / `[2j]`. CA-004 is "accessors + macros + downgrade rule"; the end-to-end binding lands in Feature B. **Status: by-design boundary; not falsely-complete.** *(049 FR-009 / research D-3.)*

**L-049-2 — `session_*`, `log_*`, `otel_*`, `app_*` C++ error variants (and `out_of_memory`) map to `FIXPP_ERR_UNKNOWN` at the C ABI in v1.0.** `[2i §4.3]` publishes no session block and no `#define` for the 1000–1099 log/otel block; `app_*` is annotated reserved/future; `out_of_memory` has no cross-cutting OOM code and a `switch(error)` cannot be call-site-dependent. There is no Feature-A function that produces these, so `→UNKNOWN` is unobservable here. The enumerating oracle asserts these arms `== FIXPP_ERR_UNKNOWN` EXPLICITLY so a Feature-B refinement trips a test rather than silently shifting the surface. **Updated (051): the reachable `session_*`/`app_*` arms are DISCHARGED** — 051 published the `[1400,1499]` block and `translate()` re-points ordinals 119/77/129/130/131 to named codes (see **B-051-3**; in `src/capi/error.cpp`'s `translate()`). This limitation now covers ONLY `log_*`/`otel_*` (`[1000,1099]`, still reserved — L-051-1) and `out_of_memory`, which remain `FIXPP_ERR_UNKNOWN` (in `src/capi/error.cpp`'s `translate()`). **Status: narrowed to log/otel + OOM; documented v1.0 behaviour.** *(049 research D-8 / data-model E-3.)*

**L-049-3 — Windows C-ABI static-link witness deferred (empirical validation, not correctness).** PR #146 corrects the `include/fix/c_api/export.h` `_WIN32` export macro so the shipped **static** archive (`fixpp_capi`) exposes plain `fixpp_*` symbols (static-archive default = empty `FIXPP_API_EXPORT`; `__declspec(dllexport)`/`dllimport` reserved behind an explicit `FIXPP_CAPI_SHARED` opt-in not used by any shipped artifact today). The corrected macro is reasoned-correct (standard static/shared ladder), leaves the POSIX `visibility("default")` branch byte-identical (Linux 6-preset verify green by construction), and is consistent with the test-only shared lib's `WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS ON` path (the Python ctypes oracle resolves `fixpp_*` by name). What is **deferred** is the *empirical* MSVC compile+link witness (e.g. `tests/capi/capi_version_smoke.c` linking `fixpp_capi.lib`), because (a) no default per-PR check gates Windows — the `windows`-MSVC lane is **opt-in via the `windows` label** (the 045 W-1 precedent), and (b) a local MSVC link-test requires the heavy manual MSVC sandbox loop (run strictly alone, never parallel with Linux). This limitation waives **validation timing**, NOT correctness: the pre-fix macro was *wrong* for the static archive; the post-fix macro is the correct standard form pending the Windows empirical witness on the next `windows`-labeled run. **Owner action to discharge:** add an MSVC/static-consumer compile+link assertion for `fixpp_strerror` + `fixpp_version` and run it under the `windows` label. *(049 export.h; [const §X.6]; 045 W-1 precedent.)*

### 050 — C-ABI Feature B (session lifecycle / send / receive callback, CA-005/006/007)

**B-050-1 — the C-ABI engine lifecycle is register-then-start-ONCE, and the boundary owns the event loop the C++ `Engine` does not.** The C++ `Engine` owns no worker threads (its `executor` doc-comment in `include/fixpp/session/engine.hpp`), so the C-ABI engine owns an internal `io_context` + worker thread(s) (count via `fixpp_engine_config_set_worker_threads`, default 1; research D-2). Lifecycle: `fixpp_engine_create` → `fixpp_session_open` × N (= `Engine::register_session`, **before** start) → `fixpp_engine_start` (= `Engine::start()`, once; spawns the role loops; rejects a null clock → `FIXPP_ERR_THREAD_CONFIG`) → drive → `fixpp_session_close` → `fixpp_engine_destroy` (drives `Engine::stop()` to completion **unconditionally**, even on a never-started engine, resets the work-guard, joins the worker(s), deletes the `Engine`; idempotent / NULL-safe / never-throws). **open ≠ connected**: establishment is asynchronous after start, so a consumer polls `fixpp_session_is_established` (= `Engine::lookup(id) != null && Session::is_open()`, `FIXPP_THREAD_SAFE`, FR-022) before sending. All engine/lifecycle symbols are `SINGLE_THREAD` per handle (`[2i §4.10]`). *(050 FR-001..004/022; `include/fix/c_api/engine.h`, `session.h`; witnessed `tests/capi/lifecycle_test.cpp`.)*

**B-050-2 — `fixpp_session_send` takes an application-message PAYLOAD (not a `fixpp_msg_t`, not a full wire frame), is `FIXPP_THREAD_SAFE`, and the session stamps the header/trailer and assigns `MsgSeqNum`.** The `frame`/`len` span MUST lead with `"35=<msgtype>\x01"` (an application MsgType) and contain only application fields, SOH-terminated; the session itself stamps `8/9/49/56/52/10` and **assigns the in-sequence `34`**, so a payload carrying session framing tags (`8/9/34/49/52/56/10`) at a field boundary is rejected (the `session.cpp` fail-closed opaque-payload validation; maps to `app_payload_malformed`, currently `FIXPP_ERR_UNKNOWN` per L-050-4). Send is callable from any consumer thread (= `Engine::send`, any-thread). The reachable return set is per data-model E-4 (see L-050-3/L-050-4 for the deferred/swallowed arms). Outbound `fixpp_msg_*` construction is Feature C. *(050 FR-007..010; `include/fix/c_api/session.h`; `tests/capi/send_recv_test.cpp`.)*

**B-050-3 — the inbound receive callback runs SYNCHRONOUSLY on the session strand on a fixpp-owned worker thread, and its `fixpp_msg_t` is valid ONLY for the callback's duration.** `fixpp_session_register_callback` installs a `{cb, userdata}` slot keyed by `SessionId` (read on the session strand); for each inbound application message the engine's internal `CapiApplication` trampoline invokes `cb` with a stack `fixpp_msg_t` (FR-013). Retaining the `inbound` handle past the callback return is a use-after-free (witnessed under ASan, SC-008). The callback MUST NOT make a **blocking** C-ABI call on its own engine/session (`fixpp_session_send`/`fixpp_session_close`/`fixpp_engine_destroy`) — it holds the strand and the blocking thunk posts onto the same strand, so it deadlocks (FR-013a); the supported "reply" pattern is copy-out-then-send-from-a-non-callback-thread (witnessed end-to-end, D-11/SC-001). Obeying that pattern is necessary but NOT sufficient: `fixpp_session_send` returning is not ordered against the peer observing the message, so a consumer that does its bookkeeping AFTER the send call can have this very callback run first and miss it — see L-050-6 (publish-first, send-second). No callbacks are delivered after `fixpp_session_close`. A callback-safe non-blocking send and richer `onLogon`/`onLogout` lifecycle callbacks are deferred (L-050-x). *(050 FR-011..013a; `src/capi/engine.cpp` `CapiApplication`; `tests/capi/send_recv_test.cpp`.)*

**B-050-4 — `fixpp_session_close` of a once-established, now-reaped session is an idempotent `FIXPP_ERR_OK`; a never-established session closes as `FIXPP_ERR_THREAD_SESSION_LIFECYCLE` (issue #151).** A reaped session is NOT gone from the registry — on peer disconnect the engine resets only the live transport and **retains** the registry entry (`unpublish_entry()`; only `Engine::stop()` clears it), so `Engine::lookup(id)` is still non-null. The reaped close therefore reaches `fixpp_session_close`'s **else branch**, where `Session::close(graceful)` on the now-`closed_drained` session returns `session_already_closed`. That one error conflates two lifecycle states: (a) the session was established at least once (logged on) and the peer has since disconnected — a normal idempotent close → `OK`; (b) the session was published but **never** logged on (e.g. an initiator that connected and sent Logon but the peer never acked, then drained) — the never-established outcome → `THREAD_SESSION_LIFECYCLE`. The two are distinguished by a sticky per-session `ever_established` latch (set once on the first `onLogon`, never reset — `established` alone is cleared by `onLogout`, so it cannot tell them apart). The `lookup()==nullptr` (null) branch remains the never-published never-established outcome (`THREAD_SESSION_LIFECYCLE`). Either way the handle is invalidated, so a subsequent `close` returns `FIXPP_ERR_INVALID_HANDLE`. Before this fix the reaped case returned `THREAD_SESSION_LIFECYCLE` (downgraded to `UNKNOWN` for a `consumer_minor<2` engine), surfacing as a spurious close error on a clean disconnect. **Status: fixed (issue #151); a public C-ABI return-contract change, landed before the 0→1 GA freeze.** *(`src/capi/session.cpp` `fixpp_session_close` else branch; `src/capi/engine.cpp` `CapiApplication::onLogon`; the OK arm witnessed end-to-end by `tests/capi/send_recv_test.cpp::CloseReapedSessionIsIdempotentOk` (real disconnect-first reap to `closed_drained`); the latch-gated `THREAD_SESSION_LIFECYCLE` arm by `CloseReapedNeverEstablishedIsLifecycle` (a seam-driven branch-discrimination witness — it flips the `ever_established` latch off on a really-drained session rather than naturally producing a connected-but-never-logged-on drain); and the never-published case by `tests/capi/lifecycle_negative_test.cpp::CloseNeverEstablishedIsLifecycleOutcome`.)*

**L-050-5 — Feature B's session-config builder exposes no transport-endpoint setter (by design); the round-trip injects the endpoint via a test-only seam.** Transport configuration (initiator connect target / acceptor listen address) is delegated to the 2j control plane per `[2i]` non-goal #7, so `fixpp_session_config_*` has no endpoint setter. The SC-001 loopback round-trip sets `SessionConfig::reconnect_endpoint` + a bilateral-lenient reset policy through a documented test-only cast bridge (`capi_loopback_support.hpp::set_loopback_endpoint`), parallel to the L-050-1 dictionary seam. A pure-C consumer configures transport through the 2j surface, not Feature B. **Status: by-design boundary; transport config owed to 2j.** *(050 spec SC-001; [2i] non-goal #7.)*

**L-050-y — a LIVE in-flight-`fixpp_session_send`-during-`fixpp_engine_destroy` cancellation (→ `FIXPP_ERR_CANCELLED`) is not safely expressible through the public C-ABI.** The C-ABI destroy contract is single-thread / quiesce-before-destroy: `fixpp_engine_destroy` frees the `fixpp_engine` and its `fixpp_session` storage, so a concurrent `fixpp_session_send` that dereferences `session->engine` is a use-after-free (ASan-confirmed), NOT a bridge defect — the caller MUST stop issuing session ops before destroying the owning engine. The FR-010 cancel-coalescing **mapping** (`operation_cancelled`/`connection_aborted`/… → the uniform `FIXPP_ERR_CANCELLED`) is witnessed at the `translate()` oracle (`error_block_test`/`error_surface_test`); the **safe sequential** teardown observable (send after `fixpp_session_close` → clean `FIXPP_ERR_INVALID_HANDLE`, never abort/UB) is witnessed by `lifecycle_test` (SC-007b rescoped). **Status: documented contract boundary; the live concurrent-cancel race is out of scope for the public single-thread-destroy ABI.** *(050 SC-007b; FR-010; tests/capi/lifecycle_test.cpp.)*

**L-050-2 — `fork()` from a process holding a live `fixpp_engine_t` leaves the child with an engine handle whose event loop no longer exists; the C ABI is not fork-safe.** Per B-050-1 the C-ABI engine owns an internal `io_context` and one or more worker threads (the C++ `Engine` owns none). POSIX `fork()` duplicates only the *calling* thread, so in the child those workers are gone while the handle, the `io_context` and any state they were holding are not — every operation that has to complete on the event loop (`fixpp_session_send`, which blocks on a `co_spawn` future per B-050-3/L-050-6; `fixpp_session_close`; the `Engine::stop()` drive inside `fixpp_engine_destroy`) has nothing left to run it. A consumer that forks must do so **before** `fixpp_engine_create`, or treat the child as owning no engine and never touch the inherited handle. This is the reason the C-ABI suite does not use gtest's `EXPECT_DEATH` (which forks) for thunk-boundary abort coverage and traps in-process instead. **Status: `wontfix`** — `fork()` in a threaded process is a POSIX constraint the library cannot lift; no `pthread_atfork` handler can reconstruct the worker threads' in-flight asio state. *(Documents shipped behaviour cited in code as `L-050-2` from `src/capi/capi_internal.hpp` and `tests/capi/thunk_split_test.cpp`; see B-050-1 for the thread-ownership model.)*

**L-050-3 — a store *I/O persistence* failure on the send path is NOT observable as a `fixpp_session_send` error.** The engine's durable-before-transmit store on `Session::send` is **logged-then-proceed** — the inherited I-07 invariant shared with 007/024/029/032: `store_then_emit` swallows store errors (`(void)store_r;` in `src/session/session.cpp` `store_then_emit`), propagating only `operation_aborted` (as `dispatch_aborted` → `FIXPP_ERR_CANCELLED`). So a C consumer cannot observe a store I/O failure (`store_io_failure` 56 / `store_capacity_exhausted` 59) as a distinct send return; the only **store-domain** code reachable on `send` is `store_seqnum_overflow` (outbound counter at `seqnum_max`, `seqnum_manager.cpp` — "Overflow check: at seqnum_max") → `FIXPP_ERR_STORE_RUNTIME`. This is an inherited engine behaviour, not introduced by Feature B — a wrapper feature cannot make a swallowed persistence failure surface; doing so needs a wider engine change (out of scope). Gate A round 3 corrected the round-1 E-4 mislabel of `store_io_failure` as send-reachable. **Status: inherited engine invariant; documented v1.0 behaviour.** *(050 data-model E-4; spec AC3/US2; `src/session/session.cpp` `store_then_emit`.)*

**L-050-x — `onCreate`/`onLogon`/`onLogout` lifecycle callbacks at the C boundary are deferred; v1.0 ships only the FR-022 establishment poll accessor.** The C++ `Application` has the richer lifecycle callbacks, but Feature B exposes only `fixpp_session_is_established` (poll) for a consumer to wait for logon before sending (SC-001). Surfacing the establishment *transitions* as C callbacks (and the companion callback-safe non-blocking send noted in B-050-3 / FR-013a) is a v1.x follow-up. **Status: documented follow-up; out of scope for Feature B.** *(050 spec Out of Scope / FR-022 / FR-013a; clarifications 2026-06-24.)*
**L-050-6 — `fixpp_session_send` returning `FIXPP_ERR_OK` is NOT ordered with respect to the peer observing the message: the reply's `fixpp_recv_cb` can run BEFORE `send` returns, so state used to correlate or observe a response to this send must be published BEFORE the send call, never after it.** `fixpp_session_send` blocks on `fut.get()` over a `co_spawn` onto the engine's `io_context` (`src/capi/session.cpp`, `fixpp_session_send`), and every layer of the coroutine chain it awaits is checked for success before `OK` is produced: `Engine::send`'s control-strand hop and session-strand hop (`src/session/engine.cpp`), `Session::send`/`send_impl` and `store_then_emit` (`src/session/session.cpp`), and `live_write_serialized_`'s `co_await live->async_write(frame)` call (`src/session/session.cpp`), whose failure is mapped to an error return rather than swallowed. So `FIXPP_ERR_OK` means the **local send pipeline completed** — down to and including the local `Transport::async_write` returning success, subject to L-050-3's swallowed store-I/O arm — never merely *dispatched* or *accepted for send*. This row establishes nothing past that point: it makes no claim about kernel socket buffers or bytes leaving the host, and it does not mean the peer observed, processed, or acknowledged the message — the peer's read, its reply, that reply's arrival on this process, and this session's strand invoking the registered callback are all concurrent with the sending thread's return from `.get()`. There is no happens-before edge from "the peer received it" to "`send` returned". Under the **current synchronous C ABI** none can be manufactured: the ordering a consumer would want — defer inbound dispatch until an unrelated outbound `send` returns — is exactly the strand self-deadlock B-050-3 forbids. A different API contract (an async send with a completion hook, explicit correlation registration, or library-side reply-dispatch gating) could offer a different ordering guarantee, which is why B-050-3 already defers exactly that as L-050-x. The peer's read is unorderable by any library; under the current blocking ABI the callback dispatch that a consumer actually cares about is unorderable too, but only because of that ABI's shape, not because ordering is inherently impossible. This is a **temporal** gap, not a memory-model one: making the consumer's flag `std::atomic` with release/acquire does not close it, because there is no edge to order. The consequence is a real consumer race in the single most common FIX client pattern, order bookkeeping: `rc = fixpp_session_send(s, order, len); if (rc == FIXPP_ERR_OK) pending[cl_ord_id] = ctx;` — the reply's `fixpp_recv_cb` (on the session strand, a fixpp-owned worker thread, B-050-3) can look up `cl_ord_id` and miss it before that assignment lands, and if `pending` is a plain container the two accesses are additionally a data race. **The rule is publish-first, send-second:** perform the bookkeeping needed to correlate or observe a response to this send — under whatever lock or atomic the callback itself uses — BEFORE calling `fixpp_session_send`, and undo it on a non-`OK` return; unrelated or independently-synchronized callback state is not covered (see also L-050-3 for the store-I/O arm this row does not report). **Status: `wontfix` for the current synchronous C ABI** — the ordering a consumer would want is exactly the strand self-deadlock B-050-3 forbids, so the contract is publish-first/send-second. *(Mechanism confirmed by a test that made exactly this mistake: `tests/capi/send_recv_test.cpp::TwoEngineRoundTripReplyFromDrainThread` waited on the reply arriving at A and then asserted B's own post-`send` bookkeeping flag — read false in 9 ms on CI `linux-clang-debug`, and reproduced 2/30 under a local single-core starvation harness; issue #283. Fixed test-side by putting every asserted post-condition into the wait predicate.)*


### 051 — C-ABI Feature C (message field/group accessors + outbound construct/commit + toApp hook, CA-008/009/010)

**B-051-1 — a pure-C consumer can read any inbound field/group and construct/commit/send any outbound message entirely through `extern "C"`; the Python bindings unblock on this 33-symbol surface.** Inbound READ (CA-008/CA-010-read, `message.h`): `fixpp_msg_get_{string,bytes,int,double,decimal}` + `has_tag`/`version`/`get_msg_type` + `fixpp_msg_get_group`/`group_get_field_*`/`get_nested_group` — thin thunks over `wire::MessageView::get`/`OffsetTable::group_slices`; string/bytes ALIAS the wire buffer (no copy); zero-global-heap (SC-003 dual gate: counting-resource + mallocnesia). Outbound CONSTRUCT (CA-009/CA-010-write): `fixpp_msg_create_outbound`→`set_*`/`remove_tag`/group builder (`msg_group_begin`/`group_builder_add_entry`/`entry_set_*`/`entry_group_begin`/`msg_group_end`)→`fixpp_msg_commit`→Feature-B `fixpp_session_send`→`fixpp_msg_destroy`. Steady-state set_*/commit are zero-global-heap (per-message monotonic arena). MINOR 0.3.0→0.4.0. *(051 FR-001..012; `include/fix/c_api/message.h`; `tests/capi/message_{read,write}_test.cpp`.)*

**B-051-2 — inbound messages are immutable; mutation requires `fixpp_msg_clone` first, which is also the only sanctioned cross-strand-handoff path. `fixpp_msg_destroy` is NULL-safe + single-destroy only: double-destroy of the same non-null pointer is UB (consumer must null their pointer after destroy).** `set_*`/group-build on an inbound flyweight → `FIXPP_ERR_INVALID_HANDLE` (`[2i §10] Q5`). `fixpp_msg_clone` produces a session-independent owner-controlled copy (own per-message arena, NOT token-expired by session close); clone reads are `FIXPP_THREAD_SAFE` (a documented runtime/handle-state guarantee OUTSIDE the static per-symbol reentrancy gate — the gate carries one conservative `FIXPP_REQUIRES_SESSION_LOCK` per shared read symbol). The outbound `fixpp_msg_t` is **token-expired on owning-session close/destroy** (FR-009a, lazy `weak_ptr<SessionLiveness>` token reset on every arena-teardown path) → post-close `set_*`/`commit` → `INVALID_HANDLE`, never a session-arena UAF (the accumulator is shell-owned; the token is the semantic validity gate). `fixpp_msg_destroy` **frees the shell** (unlike engine handles O(few), msg handles are per-send/unbounded — retaining dead shells would leak indefinitely; B-051-2 narrowed destroy contract vs. the engine pattern). *(051 FR-007/009/009a/018; seam #13 `tests/capi/msg_clone_cross_strand_test.cpp`; tombstone ASan+TSan in `message_write_test.cpp`.)*

**B-051-3 — the `[2i §4.3]` amendment publishes a dedicated Phase-4 session/app + message-construction error block `[1400,1499]`; the five reachable `session_*`/`app_*` arms now surface stable named codes, with a per-code forward-compat downgrade.** Six codes 1400–1405: `SESSION_INVALID_ARGUMENT`(1400)/`SESSION_INVALID_STATE`(1401)/`APP_DO_NOT_SEND`(1402)/`APP_CALLBACK_THREW`(1403)/`APP_PAYLOAD_MALFORMED`(1404) re-point the five C++ ordinals 119/77/129/130/131 off `FIXPP_ERR_UNKNOWN`; `MSG_FRAMING_TAG_FORBIDDEN`(1405) is a pure C-ABI construction reject (set_* of a framing tag 8/9/34/49/52/56/10). The scalar `kIntroducingMinor` is replaced by a PER-CODE lookup (existing codes minor 2, the six new minor 4) so a `consumer_minor=3` engine downgrades only the new codes and never the existing ones. **Discharges L-050-4 + L-049-2 (session/app arms; log/otel stay deferred-by-design — see L-051-1).** *(051 FR-013..017; `error.h`/`error.cpp`/`error_codes_v1.txt`/`check_capi_occupancy.sh`/`.specify/2i-capi.md`; `error_surface_test.cpp` + `error_block_test.cpp`.)*

**B-051-4 — a C consumer can register a send-side (toApp) callback to inspect/veto outbound messages on the originate path.** `fixpp_session_register_send_callback` (pre-start) routes through `CapiApplication::toApp` to a CLOSED-enum verdict (`fixpp_toapp_verdict`: SEND=0 / VETO=1 / ERROR=2; out-of-range → ERROR, a defined misuse path — NOT an alias of `fixpp_error_t`): SEND→transmit/`OK`; VETO→`FIXPP_ERR_APP_DO_NOT_SEND` (DoNotSend, nothing transmitted); ERROR→`FIXPP_ERR_APP_CALLBACK_THREW` (terminal-close). Inside the callback the outbound message is a read-only **FRAMED** view — session-stamped framing tags 8/9/34/49/52/56/10 ARE readable (distinct from the outbound accumulator, which forbids them). Scope is the **originate-path tap only** (ResendRequest retransmissions are not surfaced — L-019-4); `toAdmin` is not exposed in v1.0. *(051 FR-022..024; `session.h`/`session.cpp`/`engine.cpp`; `tests/capi/toapp_callback_test.cpp`.)*

**L-051-1 — log/otel C-ABI error arms remain `FIXPP_ERR_UNKNOWN` (no C-ABI functions yet; post-v1).** The `[1000,1099]` log+otel block stays reserved with no `#define`; `translate()` maps `log_*`/`otel_*` → `FIXPP_ERR_UNKNOWN`. L-049-2 is discharged ONLY for the reachable session/app arms — the log/otel leg is deferred-by-design (their C-ABI functions do not exist), not an open gap. **Status: documented v1.0 behaviour; awaits the log/otel C-ABI surface.** *(051 spec Out of Scope; FR-014.)*

**L-051-2 — outbound-accumulator clone (`fixpp_msg_clone` on an un-committed outbound handle) is not supported in v1.0; clone covers inbound + framed views.** `fixpp_msg_clone` produces an inbound-flavoured readable copy from the source's wire bytes; an un-committed outbound accumulator has no wire bytes to copy, so cloning one returns `FIXPP_ERR_INVALID_HANDLE` (CA-009 scope). A consumer clones AFTER commit/receive. **Status: documented v1.0 scope boundary.** *(051 FR-009; `src/capi/message_write.cpp` `fixpp_msg_clone`.)*

**L-051-3 — an empty repeating group (`NoXxx=0`) followed by more fields reads as absent rather than count-0 (pre-existing parser limitation, surfaced by CA-010-read).** The dict-aware `OffsetTable::group()` (hardened in 051 to make `TYPE_MISMATCH` reachable for a scalar tag) infers group extent from the delimiter, not the `NoXxx` count value; a zero-instance group that is not the last field returns an absent result (→ the read thunk reports `TYPE_MISMATCH`/`TAG_NOT_FOUND`) instead of an OK count-0 cursor. This is pre-existing (the parser never read the count value) and net-safer than the prior behaviour (which returned bogus slices). **Status: documented edge; a count-value-aware empty-group read is a post-v1 parser change.** *(051 wire `OffsetTable::group()`; deviation D1.)*

**(workstream, not L-) — `abidiff` layout-gate upgrade deferred to the final CA feature / release gate (research D-6).** The per-PR `abi-golden` gate stays the nm symbol-set check (golden list updated +3: `fixpp_library_version`/`fixpp_strerror`/`fixpp_version`); the decimal renumber is invisible to it (`#define`s, not symbols) — its safety net is the enumerating oracle + `error_codes_v1.txt`.

### 052 — C-ABI Python-readiness (dictionary loader + transport-endpoint config + inbound field iteration)

**B-052-1 — a pure-C / Python consumer can now load a real FIX dictionary from XML, configure a session's TCP endpoint and seqnum-reset policy, stand up a live two-engine initiator/acceptor pair, and enumerate inbound fields — entirely through public `extern "C"` headers; PY-001 unblocks on this 7-symbol surface.** `fixpp_dict_load_from_xml`/`fixpp_dict_destroy` (`dict.h`) construct the `fixpp_dict_t` that `fixpp_session_config_set_dictionary` consumes (construction-time thunk → `FIXPP_ERR_CAPI_CONFIG_INVALID` on `XmlLoader` throw; full-critical-section process-global mutex destroy + tombstone, TSan-clean concurrent double-destroy). `fixpp_session_config_set_tcp_endpoint`/`fixpp_session_acceptor_bound_endpoint`/`fixpp_session_config_set_reset_seqnum_policy` (`session.h`, +1 C11 `fixpp_reset_seqnum_policy` enum) promote the former L-050-1/L-050-5 test seams to public setters: a pure-C initiator dials a `host:port`, an acceptor reads back its OS-assigned port-0 binding, and the seqnum-reset policy is settable. **D-4 empirically settled: the production-default `bilateral_strict` establishes a fresh both-side-`reset_on_logon` pair through the public C-ABI (20/20 over loopback) — the E-4 LENIENT contingency was NOT needed.** Additive MINOR 0.4.0→0.5.0; NO new `fixpp_error_t` codes (occupancy gate UNCHANGED). *(052 FR-001..005b/012/014; `include/fix/c_api/{dict.h,session.h}`; `tests/capi/{dictionary_load_test,public_roundtrip_test}.cpp`.)*

**B-052-2 — field iteration exposes inbound fields as `(tag, value, len)` views aliasing the wire buffer, dictionary-agnostic, one entry per wire occurrence (a multiset), valid for the parent handle's own lifetime (the dispatch window for inbound; until destroy for a 051 clone).** `fixpp_msg_field_count`/`fixpp_msg_field_at` (`message.h`, + the PoD `fixpp_msg_field_t`) wrap `wire::OffsetTable::entries()` in wire/document order: `field_at(i)` returns `entries()[i]` `{tag, wire_base+offset, len}` with NO copy and zero global heap (mallocnesia LD_PRELOAD dual gate). Enumeration is a strict superset of the scalar getter (a repeating group's delimiter tag appears once per instance, vs `get_string`'s first-occurrence). A positive `tag_ != FIXPP_HANDLE_TAG_MSG` guard rejects a type-mismatched/destroyed handle (`INVALID_HANDLE`); `index >= count` → `INDEX_OUT_OF_RANGE`. Static reentrancy class `FIXPP_REQUIRES_SESSION_LOCK`; a 051 clone's iteration is the documented runtime-`THREAD_SAFE` cross-strand path. *(052 FR-006/007/008/011, SC-002/003; `include/fix/c_api/message.h`; `tests/capi/message_field_iteration_test.cpp`.)*

**L-052-1 — only the XML-path dictionary loader ships; bytes/string and builtin-by-version loaders are deferred (additive, post-v1 or PY-driven).** `fixpp_dict_load_from_xml` reads a filesystem path; `XmlLoader::load_from_string` and a builtin-by-version constructor are not surfaced in v1.0. **Status: documented v1.0 scope boundary.** *(052 spec Out of Scope; FR-001.)*

**L-052-2 — only a primitive `(host, port)` plaintext-TCP endpoint setter ships; transport-level handles, the `fixpp_endpoint_t` PoD, and `reconnect_policy`/`connect_info` configuration stay deferred to v1.x per `[2i §7.8]`.** GAP-002 is a recorded LOCAL Gate-A deviation (a primitive setter, NOT a reopened `[2i]`); set-time validation is empty-host only (`FIXPP_ERR_CAPI_CONFIG_INVALID`), with host-format rejection deferred to engine connect/accept. **Status: documented v1.0 scope boundary.** *(052 spec Out of Scope; FR-004/005a; `[2i §7.8]`.)*

**L-052-3 — field iteration is over parsed/inbound messages only; outbound-accumulator iteration is unspecified in v1.0.** `fixpp_msg_field_count`/`field_at` resolve an inbound/clone Index-mode `MessageView`; an un-committed outbound accumulator is not an enumeration source (consistent with L-051-2's outbound-clone boundary). **Status: documented v1.0 scope boundary.** *(052 spec Out of Scope; FR-006.)*

**L-052-4 — `fixpp_dict_destroy`'s dead-shell registry grows unbounded under load/destroy churn.** To guarantee that a second `fixpp_dict_destroy(same_ptr)` is a safe no-op (SC-004 double-destroy idempotency), the destroyed shell is retained in a process-global registry so `tag_==DEAD` remains readable indefinitely. Growth is O(load/destroy cycle count), not O(live dicts) — a Python or C consumer that repeatedly loads and destroys the same dictionary path will accumulate one small shell (~40 bytes) per call. **Mitigation: load a dictionary once and reuse the handle for the process lifetime; call `fixpp_dict_destroy` only at final teardown.** The mechanism is intentional and cannot be changed without violating the idempotency guarantee. **Status: documented tradeoff (double-destroy-safety vs memory growth under churn).** *(052 src/capi/dictionary.cpp; [2i §4.2.1]; gate-b/r1 F4.)*

### 054 — Python GIL discipline & typed exception translation (PY-002 + PY-003)

**B-054-1 — every non-OK `fixpp_error_t` surfaced to Python raises a block-matching typed subclass of `fixpp.FixppError` carrying `.code` (int) / `.name` (symbolic, e.g. `"FIXPP_ERR_DICT_CONFIG"`) / `.message` (`fixpp_strerror` text, == `str(exc)`); `fixpp.Error` is an alias of `fixpp.FixppError` so the 053 surface survives.** The hierarchy realizes `[2m §4.6]` verbatim (root + one subclass per `fixpp_error_t` block + the five `BindingError` subclasses) plus `AppError` for the post-`[2m]` `[1400,1499]` block ([2i §4.3]/051). A single exposed translator `fixpp._map_to_class(code)` (+ public alias `fixpp.exception_for_code`) is the source of truth the SWIG out-typemap routes through (no parallel C mapping). A code in a known populated block → that block's class (e.g. future `405`→`StoreError`); a wholly unmapped block → root `FixppError` (no `UnknownError` — would collide with `Unknown`/2). A header-sourced set-equality coverage test pins the mapping to the 47 `error.h` codes. **No `include/fix/c_api.h` change — the `0→1` freeze holds; AppError mints no new code.** *(054 FR-006..010, SC-001/002/006; `bindings/python/fixpp.i`; `tests/test_exceptions.py` + `test_error_coverage.py`.)*

**B-054-2 — the three blocking binding wrappers (`session_close`, `session_send`, `engine_destroy`) release the GIL around the native call; the one bound C→Python trampoline (`fixpp_py_recv_trampoline`) reacquires it.** A documented, exhaustive GIL-discipline audit table in `fixpp.i` classifies every `%include`d C-ABI function release/hold; the bound-trampoline census states exactly one bound trampoline (the `toApp`/send callback is `%ignore`d/unbound). A local-only `FIXPP_PY_GIL_RELEASE_CANARY` build elides the release bands; a two-mode subprocess witness proves the teardown-vs-in-flight-recv-callback scenario completes in a normal build (GREEN, in-matrix) and deadlocks under the canary (RED, local-only). The witness is parameterised over ALL THREE blocking wrappers (each op targets acc/eng_a whose single worker is parked mid-callback; eng_a is pinned to `worker_threads=1`): each op is proven RED 5/5 under the canary and GREEN in-matrix, independently witnessing that each band is load-bearing. A subprocess-watchdog test pins that a raising inbound callback (staged concurrently against a blocking teardown) never deadlocks the engine. *(054 FR-001..004/011, SC-003/004/007; Gate B r1 FQ-1; `bindings/python/fixpp.i`; `tests/test_gil_release_canary.py` + `test_callback_raise_watchdog.py` + `_gil_staging.py`.)*

**L-054-1 — blocking C-ABI calls (`session_send`, `session_close`, `engine_destroy`) from inside the inbound callback DEADLOCK as-built; the binding guarantee is documentary, not enforced, in v1.0.** This covers two structurally identical cases: (a) **send-from-callback:** the as-built 050 `fixpp_session_send` blocks on the dispatch (`co_spawn(ioc_, …, use_future)` + `fut.get()`; in `fixpp_session_send` in `src/capi/session.cpp`, rule in `include/fix/c_api/session.h`); called from inside the inbound callback (on the engine worker / session strand) the worker blocks in `fut.get()` waiting for the send coroutine to run on the *same* io_context/strand, which cannot progress — a strand/io_context reentrancy deadlock. (b) **close-from-callback:** `session_close`/`engine_destroy` drain the strand (`co_spawn(close_exec, …, use_future)` + `fut.get()`); called from inside the callback the same deadlock occurs — the strand is mid-callback waiting for the close to complete. Both are **distinct from the 053 GIL-teardown deadlock** (which the PY-002 GIL release fixes). Send: **current limitation** (the `[2m §4.6]` "Session.send-from-callback is legal" claim was predicated on a *non-blocking strand-dispatch* `fixpp_session_send`; restoring true legality is a deferred **engine** item). Close: **permanent as-designed** (the `[2m §6.5]` close-from-callback ban is correct; active pre-call `CallbackReentrantClose`/1204 detection is the PY-004 director mechanism). **Mitigation (send): from the callback, `msg.clone()` + `queue.put()` to drain + `session_send` on another thread (off the strand). Mitigation (close): call `close()` from a non-callback Python thread (e.g. a shutdown-coordinator thread).** The binding-level guarantees stay **documentary** (the module docstring states the hazards); active detection (`session._in_callback` + pre-call raises) is **PY-004** for both cases. The normative `[2m]` design is amended at send-from-callback sites (§1.3 rule (2), §3.12, §6.5 carve-out table, §4.6 `CallbackReentrantClose` NOTE) and close-from-callback sites (§1.3 rule (4), §6.5 table close row, §6.5 enforcement paragraph, §4.6 `CallbackReentrantClose` docstring, §4.7 table, §8 test #4) per Article XX. **Status: documented v1.0 behaviour (Gate B r1 FQ-2).** *(054 FR-005; `.specify/2m-pybind.md` §1.3/§3.12/§4.6/§4.7/§6.5/§8; `bindings/python/fixpp.i` module docstring.)*

### 055 — Python lifetime / ownership OO layer (PY-004)

**B-055-1 — `Engine.close()` arms the engine's Python liveness sentinel before the GIL-releasing native teardown, so concurrent public engine entry fails fast with `fixpp.ObjectLifetime` (1202) instead of entering the C ABI during close.** While `Engine.close()` is parked in child-close/native-destroy work, a second Python thread attempting `engine.open_session(...)` or `engine.start()` sees `_dead == True` and raises `ObjectLifetime` without crossing the binding/native boundary. This is a characterization of the documented concurrent-close behavior, not a new synchronization primitive: the OO layer is still GIL-governed, and the guarantee is "no stale-handle C-ABI entry" rather than multi-threaded engine mutation support. *(055 FR-007/008/016, SC-001 close-race characterization; `bindings/python/tests/test_close_flow.py`.)*

**B-055-2 — the PY-004 OO callback path actively rejects ALL THREE blocking reentrant operations (`session.send`, `session.close`, `engine.close`) with `fixpp.CallbackReentrantClose` (1204).** This is the shipped `[2m]` Article XX inversion: the GIL-protected `session._in_callback` marker is set on callback entry and cleared on every exit path, and the OO wrapper now checks it before entering the C ABI for send/close/engine-destroy. The older 054 documentary rule remains relevant only to the flat-function callback path; on the OO path the as-built send-from-callback deadlock is upgraded to a fail-fast typed exception, matching close/engine-destroy. *(055 FR-017, SC-007; `.specify/2m-pybind.md` §1.3/§6.5/§6.7/§9; `bindings/python/tests/test_reentrancy.py`.)*

**L-055-1 — on CPython 3.12, the `_fixpp` extension refuses subinterpreter import outright, so the typed `fixpp.SubInterpreterRejected` (1201) constructor guard is shadowed by a stronger import-time barrier on this build.** FR-018 still holds operationally: the binding cannot be used from a PEP 554 sub-interpreter. The limitation is that the typed 1201 path is unwitnessed here because `import fixpp` itself fails first with `ImportError: module _fixpp does not support loading in subinterpreters`. **Status: documented platform/runtime limitation of the current build, not a fixpp correctness failure.** *(055 FR-018, SC-007 note; `bindings/python/tests/test_subinterpreter.py`; quickstart verified 2026-06-27.)*

### 056 — Python wheel packaging (PY-005)

**B-056-1 — the project ships ONE self-contained stable-ABI wheel `fixpp-<ver>-cp312-abi3-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl` that `pip install`s and runs on stock CPython 3.12/3.13/3.14 with no compiler / SWIG / Conan / system fixpp present.** ⚠️ **The floor moved from cp310 to cp312 after v1.0** (`requires-python = ">=3.12"`), together with the retirement of the 3.10 and 3.11 install-test legs and the addition of a 3.14 leg: an abi3 floor below the oldest tested interpreter is a claim nothing exercises. A 3.10 or 3.11 user is now refused by pip at install time rather than served an untested wheel. The single `cp312-abi3` wheel (Py_LIMITED_API floor `0x030C0000`) replaces the earlier per-version `cp310-cp310 … cp313-cp313` plan (the abi3 single-wheel pivot — USER decision at Gate A r4). The `_fixpp.so` statically links the engine + `fixpp_capi` + `-static-libstdc++/-libgcc` and builds with `with_otel=False` + static OpenSSL, so `auditwheel show`'s external-library list is EMPTY (self-contained, FR-002). The four bundled FIX dictionaries (`FIX42/FIX44/FIX50SP2/FIXT11`) are resolved through `fixpp.dictionary_path(...)` / `fixpp.dictionary_bytes(...)` over the `_fixpp_data` package — never a repo-relative path — so the round-trip works with no repo present. The C-ABI surface is byte-frozen (the `0→1` GA freeze HELD; FR-012). **Status: shipped deliverable; install-validated 3.12/3.13/3.14. ⚠️ The "3.10–3.13, SWIG 4.4.1" validation this row used to record was the v1.0 state and is now HISTORY — it describes neither the interpreters nor the SWIG this wheel is built and tested with today.** *(056 FR-001..009, SC-001..007; `bindings/python/{pyproject.toml,build-wheel.sh,cibw-before-all.sh,fixpp_dict_data.py,tests/wheel/}`; tier1.yml `python-wheel-*` jobs.)*

**B-056-2 — the typed `fixpp.SubInterpreterRejected` (1201) runtime guard is now WITNESSED on CPython 3.10/3.11 (no import barrier), where it is the SOLE guard, and the is-main check was corrected to `interp id == 0`.** On 3.12+ the single-phase import barrier refuses `import fixpp` in a sub-interpreter before the runtime check runs (L-055-1); on 3.10/3.11 there is no barrier, so the constructor-time check is the only line of defence. 056 T013 found that defence broken — the main-interpreter id captured at module `%init` is a process-global overwritten by the sub-interp's re-import, so `Engine()` was NOT rejected — and fixed it to `PyInterpreterState_GetID(PyInterpreterState_Get()) == 0` (rejects every non-main interpreter regardless of import order). ⚠️ **THAT WITNESS NO LONGER RUNS, AND THIS ROW IS THE RECORD OF IT.** The cp312 abi3 floor retired the 3.10 and 3.11 install-test legs, and the no-barrier band was *the only band where the runtime check is observable* — on 3.12+ the import barrier refuses `import fixpp` first, so the constructor-time check is never reached and a green leg cannot distinguish a working guard from a deleted one. The fix in `fixpp.i` (`PyInterpreterState_GetID(...) == 0`) is unchanged and still compiled in; what is gone is the evidence. Compounding it, `test_subinterpreter.py` `importorskip`s `_xxsubinterpreters`, which 3.13 renamed — so even the barrier-level assertion now executes on the **3.12 leg alone**. **Status: FR-018 was witnessed end-to-end on 3.10 AND 3.11 up to the floor bump; it is now INFERRED from the 3.12 barrier, which is exactly the weaker position T013 was written to escape. Mitigation: a witness that reaches the runtime check on a supported interpreter (the barrier must be bypassed or the check exercised directly) — not yet built.** *(056 T013; `bindings/python/fixpp.i`; `bindings/python/tests/wheel/test_subinterpreter.py`; cf. L-055-1.)*

**L-056-1 — the Windows wheel is DEFERRED / best-effort for v1.0; only the Linux `manylinux_2_28_x86_64` wheel is mandatory.** A separable, on-demand lane (`.github/workflows/wheel-windows.yml`, `workflow_dispatch` / `windows-wheel` label, `continue-on-error`) scaffolds the port but is NEVER a Linux merge-gate dependency (FR-011 / WIN-1). Finishing it is not trivially cheap — it needs an MSVC-flavoured before-all (Conan `compiler=msvc` + static OpenSSL, no gcc-toolset), `delvewheel` (not auditwheel) for runtime-DLL repair, and SABI/`-DPy_LIMITED_API` link validation under MSVC. **Mitigation: build from source on Windows via the existing MSVC C-ABI build, or use WSL2 + the Linux wheel. Status: documented v1.0 scope boundary; lane present but best-effort.** *(056 FR-011, WIN-1; `.github/workflows/wheel-windows.yml`.)*

**L-056-2 — the per-version `cp3XX-cp3XX` wheel fallback (FR-010) was NOT triggered; only the single abi3 wheel ships.** The abi3 feasibility gate (T004: the SWIG wrapper compiles `-fsyntax-only -DPy_LIMITED_API` against the floor's headers with zero limited-API violations) and the cross-version runtime witness (T013: clean install + locator round-trip on every matrix interpreter; `abi3audit --strict` clean) both passed, so the FR-010 contingency that would emit per-version wheels stays closed. The gate was re-run at the cp312 floor when it moved (`0x030C0000` against 3.12 headers, CLEAN — and shown able to fail first, via a TU calling the non-limited-API `PyUnicode_DATA`). **Status: contingency documented as not-triggered (abi3 shipped); retained as the recovery path should a future interpreter expose an abi3 import flake.** *(056 FR-010, T004/T013/T015.)*

**L-056-4 — the shipped wheel does NOT wrap the binaries produced by the `linux-clang-*` / `linux-gcc-*` CI builds; it is an independent build, and it differs from them in three dimensions at once.** `python-wheel-build` compiles the engine from source inside a **manylinux_2_28** container with `gcc-toolset-14`, `build_type=Release`, `-o fixpp/*:with_otel=False` and static OpenSSL (`bindings/python/cibw-before-all.sh`), statically linking the whole engine plus `fixpp_capi` into `_fixpp.so`. The Tier 1 matrix legs that run the Python **test suite** build with **clang 22, Debug (+ sanitizers), and `with_otel` at its default `True`** (`conanfile.py`). Those bindings are a **test vehicle only — not a byte of them ships** on the four NON-packaging legs. ⚠️ **(#254, 2026-08-09)** The vehicle is now the **six `linux` matrix legs** themselves — the separate `python-bindings` job was folded into them and deleted. That fold made "contains no Python" a property held **by construction rather than by accident**: `FIXPP_BUILD_PYTHON=ON` fires four unconditional `install()` rules, and the two `-release` legs build `fixpp-package`, so the payload would have entered those artifacts. It is suppressed by **`FIXPP_INSTALL_PYTHON=OFF`** on those six legs (the option defaults **ON**, preserving 056's LAY-1 in-tree install), guarded by a Configure-time assertion on the generated install script **and** by `fixpp::python::install-absent-witness`, a `DESTDIR` install that rejects the payload. ⚠️ The pre-existing witnesses could not have caught this: `run_package_contents_witness.cmake` checked archive formats and an **export-derived** count — a count derived from the thing under test cannot notice an addition to it — so it was **structurally blind** to added root-level files and returned 9/9 green with the payload present. **#257 closed that**: it now extracts the archive and asserts the payload two-sidedly (present at the pinned destination with the XMLs absent, or absent entirely). ⚠️ Only the ON side runs in CI, since the packaging tier is gated on `linux-gcc-release`, which is itself a packaging leg. ⚠️ **(#257, 2026-09-08) THE SECOND HALF OF THIS ROW HAS INVERTED, AND THE INVERSION IS THE POINT — do not read an older copy of this sentence as current.** `packages-linux-{clang,gcc}-release` now **DO** carry a Python payload, deliberately. It installs to **`lib/fixpp/python`** — a *pinned, prefix-relative* destination, not an inherited one, so `--prefix` / `DESTDIR` / CPack staging all work (⚠️ measured: `Python3_SITEARCH` is EMPTY on the matrix legs, so the un-pinned code would have scattered the payload across the package **prefix root** beside `include/` and `lib/`). The four bundled FIX dictionaries are **NOT duplicated** into it: the package already ships all of `dictionaries/` under `share/fixpp/dictionaries`, so the payload carries a **generated** `_fixpp_data/__init__.py` whose `DICTIONARY_DIR` is resolved against `__file__` at import time (relocatable — never a build-host path), and `fixpp.dictionary_path(...)` falls back to it. ⚠️ **That fallback is a branch the wheel cannot execute** (the wheel bundles the XMLs, so the first branch always returns), which is why it is witnessed by `fixpp::python::install-package-witness` **resolving all four dictionaries through the real locator** rather than by any file-existence check. **PRECEDENCE, since a user can now obtain `_fixpp` two ways: prefer the WHEEL.** `pip install fixpp-…whl` is the supported path and the only one install-tested across interpreters; the package payload exists so a C++ consumer who already has the package can use the bindings without a second toolchain. **Do not mix them** — they are different builds (see the interchangeability warning below), and nothing detects a mixed installation. The consequence to plan against: **the artifact users actually run is exercised only by `python-wheel-test`'s install + import + functional subset across 3.12/3.13/3.14**, while the deep testing (sanitizers, full pytest) runs against a build that differs in compiler, optimisation level, and whether OTel is compiled in at all. A Python consumer therefore needs **only the wheel** — `pip install fixpp-…whl` on x86-64 Linux, glibc ≥ 2.28, CPython ≥ 3.12 — and never a fixpp C++ package. ⚠️ The binding module shipped in a `-release` package is **compiler- and glibc-specific and NOT interchangeable with the `cp312-abi3` wheel** — it carries no manylinux tag, is built by the leg's own clang/gcc against the runner's glibc, and reaches its dictionaries through the C++ datadir rather than bundling them. It is no longer hypothetical (#257 ships it); do not mix them. ⚠️ **(#255, 2026-09-09) THE MITIGATION THIS ROW USED TO NAME HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN.** It read *"build the wheel packaging path in the `-release` legs against one pinned interpreter"* and pointed at **#255**, which is now **CLOSED, not planned**: a second `.whl` — non-manylinux, plain `linux_x86_64`, bound to the runner's glibc — is a second way to obtain the same module with no stated precedence, and #257's payload already gives a `-release` consumer importable bindings from that leg's toolchain. So the gap above is **accepted, not scheduled**: the shipped wheel is still exercised only by `python-wheel-test`'s install + import + functional subset. Do not re-read the withdrawn sentence as pending work. ⚠️ **(#255) The wheel's CONTENTS changed, and the old shape is worth recording because every gate was green while it held.** `wheel.exclude` had only ever excluded `include/**`, so **every other `install()` rule in the root CMakeLists landed in the wheel**: 10 static archives, 11 loose `.o`, `lib/cmake/fixpp/`, and a second copy of **all nine** dictionaries plus `orchestra/` — 35.3 MB uncompressed against a ~13.8 MB Python payload, arriving as top-level `site-packages/lib/` and `site-packages/share/` because `Root-Is-Purelib: false`. None of it was reachable: the locator resolves through `importlib.resources` against the `_fixpp_data` **package**, and `share/` is not one. ⚠️ `pyproject.toml` asserted the opposite in a comment — *"the engine static libs have no `install()` rule so they do not leak"* — which is why this is recorded as a measurement (tier1 run 34263674899, artifact unzipped) rather than as a description. The neighbouring CI step verifies the **tag**, the `NEEDED` set and abi3 conformance, all properties of the extension module, so nothing read the file list at all; `ci/check-wheel-payload.sh` now asserts it two-sidedly (the absence half alone is satisfied by an empty wheel). **Both artifact families now carry fixpp's own licence, and previously neither did.** `CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE` is consumed by interactive installers, not by the TGZ/DEB/RPM generators, and `[project] license` records an SPDX expression in METADATA rather than shipping text — so the AGPL `LICENSE` was in **none** of the `.whl`, `.tar.gz`, `.deb` or `.rpm`. One `install(FILES …)` into `${CMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR}` reaches both, which is why `wheel.exclude` drops `share/fixpp/**` but deliberately **keeps** `share/doc/fixpp/**` — the wheel redistributes the four QuickFIX-derived XMLs, so its only copy of `QUICKFIX_LICENSE.txt` and `NOTICE` lives there. Those two places are one decision. **Status: documented provenance boundary.** *(056 FR-002; `bindings/python/{cibw-before-all.sh,pyproject.toml}`; tier1.yml `python-wheel-*` + `linux` matrix.)*

## 058-async-mutex-hardening (Cluster-4 async_mutex hardening, 2026-07-02)

Closes seven Phase-0-verified concurrency defects (AM-P1..AM-P3) plus the test-validity gaps
(T-1..T-7) in the coroutine `async_mutex` primitive (`include/fixpp/core/sync/async_mutex.hpp`),
embedded in `MemoryStore`, `FileStore`, `SeqnumManager`, and `Session write_gate_`. No public API
signature change. Spec: `specs/058-async-mutex-hardening/`; contract delta:
`specs/058-async-mutex-hardening/contracts/async_mutex-contract-delta.md`.

### Behaviors

**B-058-1 — the free-list pool pop/push is now ABA-safe (generation-tagged packed head) and the bump-allocator exhaustion counter is bounded (cannot wrap and reissue a live slot).** AM-P1: the tagless Treiber free-list head is replaced by a generation-tagged packed head (`{generation:54, slot_index:10}` in the existing 8-byte `waiter_pool_free_` atom — no new member, `sizeof(async_mutex)==131120` layout golden held) plus a per-slot persistent `free_link` atomic (never the destroyed record), closing both the ABA window and the plain-`next_` data race on slot reuse. AM-P2-3: the `waiter_pool_next_` bump allocator moved from an unconditional `fetch_add` (which incremented even on capacity-check-FAILING attempts, eventually wrapping the u32 counter and re-issuing an already-live slot) to a bounded CAS that checks capacity BEFORE incrementing and can never advance past `waiter_pool_capacity_` (512 slots). Both witnessed by deterministic forced-interleaving harnesses (`test_async_mutex_aba_interleave`, `test_pool_exhaustion_reuse`), mutation-tested. *(058 FR-001/FR-009, research.md D-1/D-4; `async_mutex.hpp`.)*

**B-058-2 — the destructor precondition now catches the in-flight-resumer teardown race, and the safe-destruction happens-before is documented and TSan-modeled.** AM-P2-1/AM-P2-2: the destructor's `std::terminate()` guard is widened to trip on `in_flight_resumers_ != 0` (not just `state_`/residual-waiter checks), converting a silent cancel-delivered-then-destroy write-after-free into a loud precondition failure. The barrier decrement (resume runner, last statement) is `release`; the drain-terminal and destructor reads are `acquire` — establishing a happens-before so a caller that destroys the mutex immediately after a completed `cancel_and_drain()` cannot race a cross-executor resumer's pool writes, for the parked-then-reaped case (see L-058-1 for the excluded case). Witnessed by death tests (`test_destructor_release_death`), a cross-executor MT teardown witness (`test_drain_destroy_inflight_mt`), and a dedicated TSan-modeled mutation-proof (`test_arm64_weak_memory` D-2 epochs — relaxing either ordering produces a genuine TSan data-race report 10/10 runs). *(058 FR-002/FR-003, research.md D-2/D-3; `async_mutex.hpp`.)*

**B-058-3 — chain-walk and null-awaiter impossible states now terminate loudly instead of silently corrupting or misbehaving.** AM-P3-1/AM-P3-2: `unlock()`'s residual-list and fresh-LIFO-walk `else` arms (structurally reachable only via a corrupted invariant — a `granted` record observed mid-walk) now `assert(false, ...)` + `std::terminate()` instead of silently stepping past the corruption; the resume runner's null-awaiter arm gets the same trap, with any defensive `result_` disarm required to neutralize via `guard.release()` (never a phantom unlock). AM-P3-3 (OOM-terminate on the post-grant resume `asio::post`) is settled as the primitive's final, documented fail-stop disposition — a deliberately different posture from the pre-grant slot-assign OOM path, which fails closed with `sync_lock_alloc_failed` (see contract-delta "OOM disposition on the resume path"). All three trap arms witnessed by real fault-injection `EXPECT_DEATH` tests (`test_am_p3_impossible_state_traps`), each independently mutation-tested. *(058 FR-004/FR-005/FR-007, research.md D-5/D-6/D-8; `async_mutex.hpp`.)*

### Limitations

**L-058-1 — a waiter GRANTED (not merely parked-and-reaped) on a different executor than the drainer forfeits the safe-destruction guarantee for that window; this cross-executor granted-holder-vs-drain overlap is an explicit EXCLUSION from the supported envelope.** B-058-2's happens-before closes AM-P2-1 for a waiter that was still PARKED at drain start and got reaped (reaped → cancelled → counted runner). It does NOT cover a cross-executor waiter that was instead GRANTED before/during the drain and becomes a cross-executor *holder*: that holder decrements `active_holders_count_` (relaxed) BEFORE its own `state_` CAS, so the drain can observe `active_holders_count_==0`, finalize, and the caller can destroy the mutex while the holder's pending CAS still targets freed memory — and the destructor guard cannot catch it (both counters read 0 at that point). This is the pre-existing "Drain overlap ... is UNDEFINED" case documented in `cancel_and_drain`'s Erratum E-5/048 doc-comment (`async_mutex.hpp`) (L-048-2), now precisely scoped by the AM-P2-1 fix rather than newly introduced. **Requirement: any cross-executor waiter that was granted MUST complete its `unlock()` before the drain begins (or unlock strand-locally).** Callers that keep `cancel_and_drain()` strand-local, co-located with all acquire/cancel/unlock of the mutex (the documented contract, L-048-2), never reach this exclusion. `async_mutex` stores no executor, so there is no cheap production assertion seam for this case (same Gate-A P2-4 constraint as L-048-2) — the contract stays documentation-enforced. **Status: documented unsupported topology (exclusion, not a defect).** *(058 research.md D-2/D-3; `specs/058-async-mutex-hardening/contracts/async_mutex-contract-delta.md` "Drain / teardown contract"; `async_mutex.hpp` destructor + `cancel_and_drain` doc-comments; cf. L-048-2.)*

**L-058-2 — two `unlock()` terminal-CAS-fail → recursive-unlock arms (F4/F6) and one `push_residual` CAS-retry arm (F7) carry lane-scoped or structural coverage waivers, not correctness gaps.** F4 (fast-path terminal-CAS-fail) and F6 (post-FIFO-walk terminal-CAS-fail) are reachable in-contract but only organically hit the seam-OFF coverage lane rarely (F4, ~0.3–1.5% of hammer opportunities) or never (F6, requires two mutually-anti-correlated narrow races to coincide); both are WITNESSED by dedicated forced-interleaving seam tests (`test_async_mutex_terminal_cas_recursive_unlock`, mutation-tested RED-on-neuter) — the production lcov line is waived per the T036 lane caveat, correctness is carried by the seam witness. F7 (`push_residual`'s weak-CAS back-edge) is structurally unhittable under the supported (non-drain-overlap) contract: `push_residual` runs only inside holder-serialized `unlock()`, so `next_drain_head_` has a single writer at any instant outside the L-058-1 drain-overlap exclusion; empirically call-count == loop-iteration-count with zero variance across every trial including the highest-volume hammer run. **Status: documented coverage-lane waivers with landed correctness witnesses (not unreachable-by-design, not untested).** *(058 T036/T040/T046, `.specify/decisions/058-async-mutex-hardening-coverage-design.md`; `## Coverage` disposition to be finalized at T036/`/speckit-verify`.)*

**L-058-3 — the three blind `phase_.store(...)` transitions in `async_lock`'s initiation body (direct-grant → `granted`, cancellation-slot-`assign`-throws → `cancelled`, and `draining_` → `cancelled`) are safe only under asio's contract that a waiter's `cancellation_signal::emit()` is serialized onto that waiter's associated executor; they are NOT CAS-guarded against a concurrent `on_cancel`.** Unlike `on_cancel()`, which transitions `queued → cancelled` via a `compare_exchange` in `include/fixpp/core/sync/async_mutex.hpp` so it can never clobber a concurrent grant, the three sites in that same file — the direct-grant arm, the inherited-slot `assign`-threw fail-closed arm, and the already-draining arm — perform a plain `store()` that blindly overwrites `phase_`. This is race-free only because all three execute **synchronously inside `async_lock`'s initiation body, before the coroutine suspends**, on the waiter's associated executor — and asio guarantees `cancellation_signal::emit()` runs on that same executor and only once the operation is genuinely in flight (suspended); therefore `on_cancel` cannot interleave these stores. A caller that wires a cancellation slot whose `emit()` is driven from a *different* executor than the one the mutex operation runs on (violating asio's cancellation-association contract) would break the assumption: `on_cancel`'s `queued → cancelled` CAS could then race a blind `store(granted)`/`store(cancelled)` and tear the phase state. This is pre-existing 048 code (the E-3 / research.md D-3 fail-closed arms and the direct-grant fast path); the AM-P2-1 release-ordering fix leaves these sites unchanged. Callers that use `use_awaitable` / `co_spawn` cancellation in the standard way (the slot is associated with the coroutine's own executor) always satisfy the contract. **Status: documented contract-reliance on asio's cancellation-executor serialization (not a defect); sibling to L-058-1's cross-executor exclusion.** *(058 Gate-B Codex/Fable MINOR; `async_mutex.hpp` on_cancel + async_lock initiation; cf. L-058-1, L-048-2.)*

## 060-int128-decimal-compare (Cluster-2 residual C1 — exact wide-integer cross-exponent decimal compare, 2026-07-04)

Reverses the 001/2a Gate-A "no `__int128`" decision: `decimal_traits<pod_decimal>::compare`'s
different-exponent slow path is replaced by a branch-free `k≥19` order-of-magnitude dominance guard
+ one `mul_u64_wide` 64×64→128 widening multiply (default `__int128` path; `#else` portable fallback;
MSVC `#elif` intrinsic path). Bit-identical `strong_ordering` vs the prior branchy comparison,
default-path swap, no runtime mode flag, no public/C-ABI/wire/error/layout change (`decimal.hpp`
byte-identical). Own spec + own Gate A, catalogued as **NFR-018** — NOT part of 001-core-decimal.
Spec: `specs/060-int128-decimal-compare/`.

### Limitations

**L-060-1 — the MSVC `#elif` branch of `mul_u64_wide` (`_umul128` x64 / `__umulh` ARM64) is Tier-2-only; no Linux CI lane compiles it.** The default Linux build (GCC/Clang) takes the native `__int128` branch; the portable `#else` limb path is covered locally via a forced build (`FIXPP_DECIMAL_FORCE_PORTABLE_MUL=ON`, T013) run against the differential oracle + witness matrix. Neither Linux configuration ever compiles the `#elif _MSC_VER` arm — analogous to the L-049-3 Windows-witness-deferred shape (same class: a per-PR-invisible platform-only branch). The `_umul128`/`__umulh` signatures + arch availability were confirmed against current Microsoft `<intrin.h>` documentation (MS Learn, msvc-170) at T012, and the `#elif` conditions were kept conservative by design — a wrong guess degrades to the portable `#else` (a **perf** bug, not a correctness bug). **MSVC x64 discharged locally (T014):** the differential oracle + witness matrix ran on `windows-msvc-debug` — 11/11 oracle cells, 4/4 mul-primitive cells, 16/16 `DecimalCompare.*` witnesses, bit-identical to the reference. **Status: MSVC x64 empirically discharged locally AND CI-confirmed on the merged head** — the full 3-lane `run-tier2` CI (debug/release/asan on `windows-msvc-*`) ran GREEN on PR #165 (`windows-msvc-debug` success; all three tiers success). *(060 T012/T013/T014; `mul_u64_wide` in `src/core/decimal.cpp`; 049 L-049-3 precedent.)*

## 062-grouped-typed-read-fix (typed reads of repeating-group ENTRIES — mechanism + single-entry-per-occurrence nested, 2026-07-05)

062 removes the compile blocker where typed reads of repeating-group ENTRIES did not compile (`group_view::operator[]` span-ctor vs the generated `G_<n>` `MessageView`-ctor). It delivers the entry-read MECHANISM: span-scan scalar accessors on a generated entry flyweight (zero per-access heap alloc, no per-entry sub-index — FR-004a) plus a lazy dict-aware nested sub-view (one bounded arena build per stable outer occurrence, cached collision-free by outer-slice `data` identity — FR-004b). NO typed builders, NO writer, NO C-ABI / error-enum / wire-framing / top-level-read change (FR-007). Spec: `specs/062-grouped-typed-read-fix/`. The nested-read mechanism is unit-proven for **single-entry-per-occurrence** nesting; the two limitations below bound the MULTI-ENTRY nested case, deferred to prerequisite **063 "nested group-parse correctness"** (both defects are PRE-EXISTING and UPSTREAM of 062's RC1-frozen surface — 062 holds the whole-frame `OffsetTable::build()` guard and `group_slice.len` UNCHANGED).

### Limitations

**L-062-3 — [PINNED by 072-nested-group-hardening (2026-07-13) — parent/child scalar-member disjointness is now a permanent CI-tripping census assertion (FR-002, `reused_tag_census_test.cpp::NestedGroupScalarMemberCensus`) over all 9 runtime dicts, structurally recovered (raw `<group>` walk, so FIX40/41/42 are covered too — no unpinned residual needed). It is deliberately NOT load-enforced (FR-004): the load guard covers only the delimiter convention.] the entry `field_value(tag)` escape hatch span-scans the WHOLE entry slice (including a nested group's bytes) and returns the FIRST occurrence.** A tag that lives ONLY inside a nested group is returned by an outer entry's `field_value(tag)` as if it were an outer-entry field. This mirrors the whole-message `field_value` first-occurrence semantics (N3) and is a property of the untyped escape hatch only — the codegen-scoped TYPED accessors (`emit_scalar` / nested `group<c,G_c>()`) are membership-scoped **as a set** and unaffected on shipped dictionaries. **Note (Fable audit 2026-07-08):** each typed accessor still resolves its tag via the same flat first-occurrence `wire::get` scan over the entry slice (incl. nested bytes), so typed-path correctness rests on parent/child scalar-member tag **disjointness** — mechanically verified for all 6 vendored group-bearing dicts, but NOT enforced for a user/dialect dictionary that shares a scalar tag between a parent group and its nested child (hardening tracked in issue #180). Prefer the typed accessors when nested/outer disambiguation matters. *(062 N3; spec `field_value` note; whole-message first-occurrence precedent.)*

**L-063-1 — [RESOLVED by 082-structural-group-detection (2026-08-12, PR #261) — CLOSES issue #196.** Group detection is now **structural** at every site: the runtime registration loops in `Dictionary::as_table_view()` key on `group_first_field(no_tag) != 0` (in `src/dictionary/dictionary.cpp` for the legacy bare store, and the 063 context-scoped loop below it), and the codegen emitters discover groups from `VersionIR::group_tags` via `is_group_tag()` rather than re-deriving group-ness from `FieldRef::type` over the tag-deduped field run. **`FieldRef::type` is deliberately UNCHANGED** — FIX42's count fields still carry `INT` — which is what makes the byte-identity claims for the six unaffected dictionaries checkable rather than assumed. Registered-group counts move exactly as this row predicted: **FIX40 0→4, FIX41 0→7, FIX42 0→18, FIX43 33→34** (`+1 tag (576 NoClearingInstructions)`, a real `<group>` the upstream dictionary types `INT`); FIX44/50/50SP1/50SP2/FIXT.1.1/Orchestra-latest are **no-ops pinned by golden byte-identity**. The `v42` group codegen surface this row called "a large golden regen" is delivered — 18 `class G_` accessors in `v42/Messages.hpp` plus the full builder/validator tier (see L-077-1). **⚠️ Two citations in the 083 bracket below are now stale and are corrected here rather than edited in place, so the 083-era reasoning stays readable as written:** (i) the `fr.type != NumInGroup` gate it describes **no longer exists** — there is no line to re-point to, which is the whole content of this resolution; (ii) the exact-55 tripwire it names as `DelimiterCensus.IntTypedOutOfCheckedSetIsExactlyFiftyFive` was **INVERTED, not deleted** — those 55 contexts now REGISTER, so the assertion moved to `DelimiterCensus.IntTypedCountTagContextsAreExactlyFiftyFiveAndNowRegistered`, which pins the same 6/10/38/1 breakdown in an `int_typed_registered` bucket. Zeroing the old pin instead of inverting it would have been vacuous — a census that stopped measuring also reports 0.] **[CORROBORATED, NOT NARROWED, by 083-group-delimiter-resolution (2026-08-01) — issue #196. 083's D-12 investigation (T013) instrumented the group-detection predicate directly and landed on a THIRD branch its own task text did not offer** — not (a) "the context entry exists and is wrong" nor (b) "a type-promotion step exists between the two accessors", but **(c) no per-context entry exists at all**. Traced to source on FIX42: `NoRelatedSym(146)` is declared exactly once in the whole file, as `<field number='146' name='NoRelatedSym' type='INT'/>` in `dictionaries/FIX42.xml`, and `xml_loader.cpp` assigns the group's own count-tag `FieldRef` its type from that single global per-tag declaration with **no promotion step** between `<fields>` parsing and emission. Both accessors (`Dictionary::message_fields` span iteration and `Dictionary::field_ref` binary search) read the identical stored struct from the identical backing array, so they cannot disagree; the `fr.type != NumInGroup` gate correctly skips tag 146. Controls: `(R,382)` absent from both accessors, `(8,382)` present and `Int`-typed (its own single global `<field number='382' name='NoContraBrokers' type='INT'/>` declaration in `dictionaries/FIX42.xml`), and a positive control on genuinely-`NUMINGROUP` FIX44 `NoPartyIDs(453)` reports REGISTERED — so the "unregistered" verdicts are not a broken always-false discriminator. **Consequence: this row is confirmed exactly as written, and #196's scope is neither narrower nor wider than stated.** These contexts never enter 083's C-3.4a checked set (measured: 55 `INT`-typed-out-of-checked-set contexts across the ten dictionaries, asserted as an exact tripwire by `DelimiterCensus.IntTypedOutOfCheckedSetIsExactlyFiftyFive`), so 083's fail-closed FR-023 completeness check cannot fire on them and does not block #196. The fix remains the one this row already names — relax detection to structural — now additionally cross-referenced from `L-066-1`.] FIX40/41/42 declare group-count fields with legacy XML type `INT` (not `NUMINGROUP`), so table_view-driven and codegen group registration is INERT for them (pre-existing on `main`; discovered by the 063 census, deferred to a follow-up).** `Dictionary::as_table_view()` (both the legacy bare-`no_tag` and the 063 context-scoped registration loops) and the codegen emitter (`tools/codegen/fixpp-codegen/emit_messages.cpp`) both gate group detection on `fr.type == field_data_type::NumInGroup`. FIX 4.0/4.1/4.2's XML types every `<group>` count field as `INT` (0 matches for `type='NUMINGROUP'` across all three), so `as_table_view()` registers **zero** groups for them and the generated `v42` flyweight has **zero** `groups::`/`struct G_` repeating-group accessors — table_view-driven group parsing/validation (`wire::Validator`, `OffsetTable::group()` via `group_member_fn`) and typed group reads are inert for these three dictionaries. The raw structural accessors `Dictionary::group()`/`group_fields()` are unaffected (e.g. `group_fields(382)` on FIX42 returns its 4 members). This is **orthogonal to Defect A/B** (not a wrong-variant or extent bug — no registration at all) and **pre-existing** (present before 063). 063's census/guards (FR-002/SC-002) therefore cover the six group-bearing dictionaries (FIX43/44/50/50SP1/50SP2 + FIXT.1.1); the FIX40/41/42 gap is carved out. **Fix (deferred to a follow-up feature — 064-class legacy-vocab precedent):** relax group detection to structural (`FieldRef.group_no_tag` / the `<group>` element, which the loader already tracks independent of field type), which would additionally materialize v42's group codegen surface (a large golden regen) and FIX40/41/42 group validation — feature-sized, out of 063's Defect-A/B scope. *(063 census `tests/dictionary/reused_tag_census_test.cpp`; decided 2026-07-07; spec.md FR-002 carve-out / SC-002.)*

**L-063-2 — [RESOLVED by 065-cabi-nested-group-membership, 2026-07-10 — issue #179 nested-read defect FIXED] the C-ABI `fixpp_group_get_nested_group` positional read includes a trailing outer-level member in the LAST nested instance's field lookups — a **reachable GA C-ABI silent-wrong-value defect on any group-bearing dictionary** (exposed, not merely edge-activated, by 063's outer-slice correction; correct fix = a membership-aware C-ABI follow-up, tracked as **issue #179**).** **RESOLUTION (065):** the hand-rolled positional scanner was deleted and the nested read now delegates to the membership-aware `OffsetTable::nested_group_slices` (062) + `consume_group_extent` (063), so the last nested instance is bounded by dictionary membership and a trailing outer member reads `TAG_NOT_FOUND` (not `OK`+wrong-value). No exported-symbol/header/enum/version change (C-ABI 1.5.0 freeze held). Un-skipped witness `MessageReadGroup.NestedGroupLastInstanceExtentDoesNotAbsorbTrailingOuterMember` (mutation-proven RED on the pre-fix scanner) + dual FR-011 witnesses (direct `as_table_view()` + engine-loopback). Scope: **depth-1** (issue #179); depth-≥2 and the same-value membership-collision case remain bounded (see L-065-1, L-062-3/L-063-4/#180). Historical analysis retained below. The C-ABI nested-group read, in the since-deleted hand-rolled positional scanner formerly in `fixpp_group_get_nested_group` (`src/capi/message_read.cpp`), sliced a nested repeating group by a **positional, dictionary-membership-free** delimiter scan and closed the last nested instance at the **end of the outer occurrence's slice**. Before 063, Defect B truncated the outer slice before a nested group's 2nd entry, so this multi-instance branch was unreachable (a multi-entry nested C-ABI read returned `nc=0`). 063's nesting-aware `OffsetTable::group()` makes the outer slice correct (spans all nested entries) — a **strict improvement** for the common case — but if a well-formed message carries an outer-group member **after** a multi-entry nested group (e.g. a FIX44 ExecutionReport whose `NoLegs(555)` entry carries a multi-entry `NoLegSecurityAltID(604)` nested group followed by declared trailing leg members such as `LegQty(687)`), that trailing member's bytes fall inside the last nested instance's span, so `fixpp_group_get_field_*(nested, last_index, trailing_tag, …)` returns it (`FIXPP_ERR_OK`) instead of `FIXPP_ERR_TAG_NOT_FOUND`. **Reachability (Fable audit 2026-07-08): NOT an edge case** — the trailing-member-after-nested-group layout is ubiquitous in real dicts (scan: 222 such layouts in FIX44, ~20k in FIX50SP2), so any conforming counterparty can trigger the wrong-value `ERR_OK` via the public C-ABI; the prior "edge activated" framing understated it (issue #179). ~~**The C++ typed read path (`Dictionary::as_table_view()` → generated flyweights) is UNAFFECTED — it is membership-bounded and correct.**~~ **AMENDED by 066-dict-backed-inbound-parse (2026-07-09) — this claim was FALSE on the shipped path until 066 landed.** At the time this row was written (063, 2026-07-07), the claim was correct only for the unit-tier `Parser<access_mode::Index>{dict}` construction used by 062/063's own tests; it was never true for the SHIPPED dispatch path, because `Session::parse_and_dispatch_` (in `src/session/session.cpp`) built its `Parser` with the DEFAULT (dictionary-free) constructor — a fact discovered by the Gate-A investigation for issue #179/065 (2026-07-09) that produced 066. So the C++ typed read delivered to a real application callback was, like the C-ABI path this row documents, membership-free/positional on every inbound-dispatched message: a group's last instance ran to end-of-message on the typed path too, for the identical reason as the C-ABI defect above. **066 fixes this for the typed path (and the C-ABI TOP-LEVEL group read + scalar-as-group contract) by dict-backing `parse_and_dispatch_` itself** — see B-066-1 / contract C1 (`specs/066-dict-backed-inbound-parse/contracts/inbound-parse.md`), proven directly on shipped dispatch by `tests/session/test_066_group_membership_red_test.cpp`. **This row's original C-ABI NESTED-group defect (the trailing member absorbed into the last nested instance via `fixpp_group_get_nested_group`'s positional scan) is UNCHANGED by 066** — 066 dict-backs the top-level parse only; the nested C-ABI cursor still does its own membership-free scan. That remains the tracked **#179 / 065** follow-up (a membership-aware C-ABI nested-read fix), which per SC-005 depends on 066 having landed first. A correct nested C-ABI fix needs nested-group membership, which this positional path deliberately lacks; plan.md Round-2 explicitly rejected plumbing dict/`group_context` through the GA-frozen C-ABI cursor (a gratuitous rewrite), so the fix is a **membership-aware C-ABI follow-up feature**, out of 063's (and 066's) scope. Pinned by the `GTEST_SKIP`'d witness `tests/capi/message_read_test.cpp::MessageReadGroup.NestedGroupLastInstanceExtentDoesNotAbsorbTrailingOuterMember` (un-skipped when 065 lands). No exported C symbol / freeze change (SC-005 holds). Cross-ref the FIX4x scope carve-out at L-066-1 (tied to L-063-1). *(063 T025 / Round-2 tasks-pin #5; decided 2026-07-07; the since-deleted scanner's LCOV_EXCL rationale corrected (removed along with the scanner by 065); amended by 066 FR-010 2026-07-09.)*

**L-063-3 — [RESIDUAL (b) RETIRED by 083-group-delimiter-resolution (2026-08-01) — issue #210. The row is now fully closed: residual (a) was fixed by 072, residual (b) by 083.** `Dictionary::as_table_view()` no longer populates a context's `group_first` from the dictionary's single global first-seen `GroupRef.first_field_tag`. A per-context delimiter store (`(msg_type, parent_path, no_tag) → delimiter`) is captured at LOAD time from the FIRST field emitted into each group's field run — declaration order, which the loaders have and `message_fields()`'s tag-sorted output had destroyed — in both `XmlLoader` and `OrchestraLoader` (FR-001/FR-005). The worked example this row cites is the pin: FIX44 `NoMDEntries(268)` now resolves `269` in `MDFullGrp` (35=W) and `279` in `MDIncGrp` (35=X), so the conforming incremental-refresh message this row says false-rejects is accepted. Census assertion over all ten dictionaries: wrong-delimiter contexts **330 → 0**, of which nested **235 → 0** (`tests/dictionary/delimiter_census_test.cpp::DelimiterCensus.RedCountsReconcileWithSpecBaseline`, observed RED at those counts before the fix). **The "spurious extra member" clause is closed too, and by construction rather than by a second fix:** the delimiter is no longer injected into the member set to make the lookup work, so the per-context member set is exactly the declared one — polluted member sets **48 → 0** on the same pin (FR-015). Load disposition is fail-closed by default: a declared group that resolves no delimiter now throws (`xml_parse_error` / `orchestra_parse_error`), with an explicit `unresolved_group_policy::tolerant` opt-in that warns and skips. **What is NOT claimed:** this row's residual (b) only; L-063-4/#180's flat splitter is a different row and stays open, and the `INT`-typed FIX40/41/42 carve-out (L-063-1/L-066-1/#196) is untouched. Historical text below is retained verbatim as the pre-fix description — **do NOT read residual (b) below as current state; it is now history.]** ~~[SPLIT STATUS by 072-nested-group-hardening (2026-07-13): residual (a) FLAT WALK is FIXED — the validator Step-3 group walk was rewritten from the flat root-context pass + `seen_in_instance` heuristic into `validate_group_level`, a query-before-push RECURSIVE descent that resolves each group under its REAL parent path (`group_first_field`/`group_member_tags(msg_type, parent_path, no_tag)`) before pushing the group's own no_tag to recurse into nested children — so strict validation and typed read now agree on depth-≥2 membership. Depth-bounded by the group_context K=16 clamp. Mutation-proven by `tests/wire/validator_nested_membership_test.cpp::ValidatorNestedMembership.Depth2ContextMissUnderFlatWalk` (RED slot-38 on the flat walk, GREEN after). Residual (b) GLOBAL DELIMITER REMAINS LIVE — UNTOUCHED by 072: `Dictionary::as_table_view()` (`src/dictionary/dictionary.cpp`, unchanged by this PR) still populates every context's `group_first` from `group_first_field(no_tag)` — the dictionary's SINGLE global, first-seen `GroupRef.first_field_tag` — not a per-context delimiter. So a reused NumInGroup tag whose delimiter genuinely differs across contexts carries the first-seen variant's delimiter into every OTHER context, and the opt-in strict validator false-rejects a conforming message in any non-first-seen context. **This is reachable on SHIPPED dictionaries**, not merely a user/dialect concern: FIX44 `NoMDEntries(268)` declares delimiter `MDEntryType(269)` in `MDFullGrp` (35=W `MarketDataSnapshotFullRefresh`, first-seen) vs `MDUpdateAction(279)` in `MDIncGrp` (35=X `MarketDataIncrementalRefresh`) — a valid incremental-refresh message false-rejects under the strict validator, since `268`'s context delimiter resolves to `269` everywhere. Same class: FIX44 `NoExecs(124)` {17,32}; FIX50SP2 adds `73`,`2428`. The PR's own `tests/dictionary/reused_tag_census_test.cpp` prints `Q2 … AT LEAST ONE VARIES` for these shipped dicts (observed, not asserted — a different axis, FR-001 disjointness). Scope bound: **pre-existing / `main`-parity** (the pre-072 flat walk queried the identical global delimiter at root context, so this false-reject existed identically before 072 — 072 neither introduced nor worsened it) and **confined to the opt-in strict validator** (the default typed-read/parser path, `OffsetTable::group()`, slices on the frame's OWN wire delimiter and is unaffected). Tracked as a new follow-up (per-context delimiter needs declaration-order metadata threaded through `as_table_view()`, out of FR-010's scope). The residual (b) description below is the STILL-LIVE current state, NOT history — do not read it as superseded.]~~ *(that 072-era "STILL-LIVE" instruction is itself now superseded — see the 083 bracket at the head of this row)* strict `dictionary_driven_validator` group validation does not yet share the parser's nesting-aware, context-threaded repeating-group walk, and its per-context group DELIMITER for a reused NumInGroup tag is the dictionary's single (global, first-seen) `GroupRef.first_field_tag`.** Two residuals in the opt-in strict validator's Step-3 group check (`include/fixpp/wire/validator.hpp`), both confined to validation/reject behaviour — the C++ typed-read/parser path (`OffsetTable::group()` → generated flyweights) is UNAFFECTED. **(a) Flat walk (FIXED by 072, see bracket above):** `validate()` scans `msg.offsets().entries()` non-recursively and queries every group at ROOT context (`{msg_type, path=[]}`); a genuinely NESTED reused tag misses the context store and degrades to the legacy bare-`no_tag` (Defect-A-affected, `main`-parity) resolution, and the flat instance counter cannot span a multi-entry nested group (same shape as the pre-063 parser `seen_in_instance` truncation). **(b) Global delimiter:** `Dictionary::as_table_view()` sets the context store's `group_first` from `group_first_field(no_tag)` (= `GroupRef.first_field_tag`, the declaration first field), which is keyed by `no_tag` globally (one `GroupRef` per `no_tag`, first-seen for reused tags) because `message_fields()` is tag-sorted and so preserves no per-message declaration order to derive a context-exact delimiter from. So a reused NumInGroup tag whose delimiter genuinely differs across contexts gets the first-seen variant's delimiter in the non-first context (and, because the delimiter is also registered as a member, that one delimiter may be a spurious extra member of that context's set when it is not otherwise present — a lenient membership false-positive within this same residual). The per-context MEMBER SET is otherwise context-exact (the Defect-A fix). **This replaced a worse bug:** `group_first` was previously `members.front()` (the LOWEST-TAG member of the tag-sorted per-message set, not the delimiter), which made the validator falsely reject valid real-dictionary groups whose delimiter is not their lowest-tag member — e.g. FIX44 `NoPartyIDs(453)` (delimiter `PartyID(448)`, lowest member `PartyIDSource(447)`). That false-rejection is FIXED and pinned by the mutation-proven witness `tests/wire/validator_production_table_view_test.cpp::ValidatorProductionTableView.GroupDelimiterFromWireNotTagSortedMember`. **Fix (deferred follow-up):** give the validator the same context-threaded, nesting-aware descent as `OffsetTable::consume_group_extent` (resolving membership by real context and consuming nested extents recursively), which subsumes both residuals. *(discovered in 063 Gate-cleanup review 2026-07-07; delimiter-source fix landed in `dictionary.cpp` `as_table_view()`; nesting/ reused-delimiter residual deferred.)*

**L-063-4 — [LEG 2 DELIVERED by 085-fold-flat-cap-loop (2026-08-03) — closes fixpp#214.**
> **Leg 2 — *"fold the redundant flat cap loop into the same traversal"* — is DONE.** `OffsetTable::group()`'s dictionary branch no longer re-walks the group's extent after `consume_group_extent` returns. The flat per-instance cap loop was **relocated** into the dict-free `else` branch (the only path that still needs it) and deleted from the dictionary path, so that path now performs **exactly one** traversal. The removal is a strict no-op on observable behaviour: the flat cut-set over `[first, group_end]` was a superset of the nesting-aware instance starts and `consume_group_extent` returns on breach first, so the second loop's cap comparison could never be the first to fire. Delivered as a **pure move** — the relocated lines are byte-identical modulo a uniform 4-space indent shift — and pinned permanently by the source-inspection gate `WireOffsetTable.FR001_SingleTraversalSourceInspection` (RED before the move, GREEN after), whose second discriminant also forbids an `else`-inverted rewrite. The dictionary path's per-instance DoS defence is now solely `consume_group_extent`'s cap over the instances whose extent it returns, mutation-proven RED post-relocation (and recorded GREEN pre-relocation, which is what makes that RED attributable). **fixpp#180 is NOT reopened** and **leg 1's disposition below is unchanged**: leg (a) remains NOT DONE, descoped with evidence by 083 (zero target population across all ten dictionaries; a literal implementation would break the 485-context shape that *is* reachable). This bracket adds leg 2 only.
> **Two flat instance-boundary rules SURVIVE ON PURPOSE — "leg 2 delivered" does NOT mean "no flat rules remain".** Both are named here with the reason each was kept, so the row cannot be misread as a blanket claim. *(Line numbers are as-of 085's delivered tree; each site is named by function and role first so the reference survives re-numbering.)*
>   1. **The dict-free cap check in `OffsetTable::group()`** — the relocated loop itself, now the `else` branch's per-instance cap. **Why kept:** it is the *entire* DoS defence for non-dictionary callers, who have no membership oracle and therefore no nesting-aware walk to fold into. Removing it would silently drop the cap on that path; 085 adds `WireOffsetTable.DictFreeDoSCapPerInstanceRejectsOversizedInstance` + `…AllowsWhenCapRaised` precisely to pin it, mutation-proven RED.
>   2. **The instance splitter in `OffsetTable::group_slices_status()`** — its delimiter resolution and flat boundary walk. **Why kept:** this is L-063-4 **leg 1**, descoped with evidence by 083 and re-affirmed above; it is out of 085's scope entirely. Note `OffsetTable::group_slices()` is only the delegating wrapper — it forwards to `group_slices_status` and contains no splitting logic of its own, so the splitter must be cited at the latter.
> **These two do NOT merely share a flat *shape* — their delimiter SOURCES differ, and that distinction is load-bearing.** `OffsetTable::group()`'s own `delim` and `consume_group_extent`'s are both read from the **wire** (identical by construction, both `entries_[count_idx + 1U].tag`). The `group_slices_status` splitter instead resolves its delimiter from the **per-context dictionary store** via `group_delim_fn_`, which is 083's change across **330** contexts. So the surviving flat rules are not two instances of one pattern awaiting one fix: folding the splitter is a *dictionary-keyed* problem (leg 1), while the dict-free cap is a *wire-keyed* one that has no dictionary to fold into. Two walks over one extent with independent delimiter sources have shipped on `main` since 083 (see FR-007a / E-3) — recorded here so a future reader does not treat the residual flatness as a single outstanding item. ⚠️ **AMENDED 2026-09-07 (fixpp#389): the word was "benignly", and that was FALSE.** One consequence of the two independent delimiter sources was a live memory-safety defect for the whole of 083 — `group_slices_reserve_bound()` sized the shared slice vector from the WIRE-delimited, `declared`-capped extent walk while the splitter re-split that extent with the DICTIONARY delimiter under no cap, so the reserve could be exceeded and spans already handed out for other `no_tag`s dangled. Fixed by **B-389-1** (per-group exact-sized arrays; the estimator deleted). The SEMANTIC divergence described above is still real, still deliberate, and still this row's subject — what is retracted is only the claim that it had shipped harmlessly. **A "benign so far" is a measurement of attention, not of the code.**

> *(083 bracket follows, unchanged)* [RE-STATED by 083-group-delimiter-resolution (2026-08-01) with THREE dispositions.**
> **FIRST, a correction to this row's own tracking claim — `#180` is CLOSED, and was already closed before 083 began** (2026-07-13, by **072-nested-group-hardening**). Its scope was what its title says: *"Harden dictionary census: pin nested≠parent delimiter + parent/child scalar-member disjointness"* — census pins plus a load-time guard, **both delivered by 072**. The two-leg splitter fix below is this row's own *"Fix (deferred follow-up)"* paragraph and was **never `#180`'s deliverable**. 083's task text (T071) was written on the premise that `#180` was open and that this feature had to avoid closing it; that premise was false and the tracking sentence is corrected here rather than propagated. **Consequence, stated because it is the actionable part: with `#180` closed, the deferred splitter fix below had NO tracking issue at all.** 083 files one for the remaining leg (see leg (b)).
> **(a) Leg 1 — *"make the splitter nesting-aware"*: NOT DONE, DESCOPED WITH EVIDENCE.** 083 measured the target population under the POST-FIX (per-context) delimiters across all ten dictionaries: for every context with delimiter `D`, does any group nested directly inside it carry `D` as a member? **Zero, on every dictionary** (FIX40/41/42/43/44/50/50SP1/50SP2/FIXT11/Orchestra FIX Latest). And the shape is not merely absent — it is **unparseable**: two synthetic dialects built to witness the mis-split were both genuinely ambiguous on the wire (nested delimiter == outer delimiter → the validator rejects the frame outright, which is the layout 072's load guard exists to reject; nested delimiter distinct but the outer delimiter a LATER member of the nested group → the nested walk swallows the next outer instance). A tag that both opens outer instances and appears inside them has no unique parse — which is *why* no shipped dictionary carries one. Worse, implemented literally leg 1 would **break** the shape that IS reachable: where the outer delimiter is itself a nested group's count tag (485 contexts), skipping past the nested extent before testing the boundary would skip the very tag that opens each instance. Recorded in `tests/wire/typed_read_split_agreement_test.cpp` with the shapes tried.
> **(b) Leg 2 — *"fold the redundant flat cap loop into the same traversal"*: OUTSTANDING**, unchanged, and now **tracked by fixpp#214** (filed by 083 because closing `#180` in 072 left this residual orphaned). The residual is the one flat, wire-derived instance-boundary rule in `OffsetTable::group()` (`src/wire/offset_table.cpp`) — cited under 072-era line numbers that have since drifted. Its exposure is a `max_group_entries_per_instance` false positive/negative on a defence-in-depth DoS cap, never wrong returned data.
> **(c) This row's own claim that `consume_group_extent()` correctly computes the nesting-aware `group_end` — CORRECTED, it is FALSE.** The row was audited against the *nested-delimiter-equals-parent-delimiter* shape only. It is wrong for a **third** shape it never named: **the outer group's delimiter IS a nested group's count tag.** There the instance-opening delimiter was consumed by a bare `++k`, leaving the walk inside the nested group's instances, so the next outer instance's opening tag was never reached and the extent truncated to ONE instance — silently, through `MessageView::group<>()` and the C-ABI top-level group getter. Present in **485** contexts (FIX50SP2 240 + Orchestra 245) and made *reachable* by 083's delimiter correction. Repaired by a query-before-consume descent at the delimiter position, in `consume_group_extent`'s `consume_one` lambda (`src/wire/offset_table.cpp`), mirroring the pre-existing post-delimiter descent in the same function, with the depth-cap early return mirrored too. Witnessed by `TypedReadSplitAgreement.ExtentWalkDescendsAtNestedGroupDelimiter_Leg{1..4}`.
> **What 083 DID change at the splitter is not one of this row's legs:** the boundary delimiter's **SOURCE** moved from the wire (`entries_[first].tag`) to the dictionary's per-context store, so the splitter and the validator now split on the same key. *(A line-number pin that stood here was already stale before #384 — it pointed at the cached-span early return, not the delimiter resolution. Read the symbol instead: `OffsetTable::group_slices_status()`.)* The splitter is still **flat**. Pinned by `TypedReadSplitAgreement.OutOfScopeWireProbesUnchanged`, which also asserts the extent bound and `group()`'s `group_index` do **not** move. *(⚠️ It formerly asserted the RESERVE BOUND was unmoved too — that probe is retired by #389, which deleted the estimator it read. The probe was true and the property it was read as certifying was not: see B-389-1.)*
> **Neither leg is claimed as delivered by 083, and `#180` is NOT reopened** — 072 delivered what `#180` actually asked for. What 083 adds is evidence (leg (a) descoped, measured), a correction (leg (c)), and a tracking issue for the residual (leg (b)).
> **The row's *"0 nested/parent delimiter collisions"* measurement (Fable audit 2026-07-08), re-derived on the POST-FIX basis as FR-012a/SC-014 requires:** still **0**, now across all **ten** dictionaries rather than the six group-bearing ones, and now under delimiters that 083 changed in 330 contexts. The re-derivation was necessary precisely because the original was taken against the delimiters this feature replaced.]
> *(historical 072 bracket follows)* [PINNED + LOAD-GUARDED by 072-nested-group-hardening (2026-07-13) — `XmlLoader::load_*` now REJECTS a dialect in which any nested group's delimiter (`first_field_tag`) equals its immediate parent group's delimiter, throwing `dict::group_delimiter_collision_error` (derives `dict::xml_parse_error`, reuses inherited `code()`, discriminated by catch type — no `core::error` append). Enforced in `LoaderState::finalize()` before any `table_view` is built; `as_table_view()` stays non-throwing. A permanent all-contexts census (FR-001, `reused_tag_census_test.cpp::NestedGroupDelimiterCensus`, raw per-`<group>` walk with parent-delimiter threading + component expansion + post-expansion delimiter) pins 0 collisions across all 9 runtime dicts non-vacuously. RECORDED RESIDUALS (caller responsibility, not covered): (a) a hand-built `table_view` / non-`load_*` `Dictionary` is not re-validated (FR-005a); (b) the loader `groups_` table is global-first-seen-deduped per no_tag, so a collision only in a non-first-seen context of a reused no_tag is unguarded (FR-005b); (c) scalar-member disjointness is census-only, not load-enforced (FR-004); (d) the FR-002 scalar census recovers member sets structurally for all 9 dicts incl. FIX40/41/42 (no unpinned residual required); (e) the FR-001/FR-002 census coverage is bounded to the membership contexts the raw walk structurally reaches. The splitter itself remains flat, but is now unreachable for the collision case via the load path.] `OffsetTable::group_slices()`'s slice splitter (and its redundant flat cap loop) re-walk the group's extent FLAT, not nesting-aware — a defense-in-depth gap deferred as real-dictionary-unreachable.** `consume_group_extent()` (`src/wire/offset_table.cpp`) correctly computes the nesting-aware `group_end` for the outer group, but `group_slices_status()`'s instance splitter and its redundant post-extent cap loop then re-walk that extent with a **flat** "does `entries_[k].tag == delim` mark a new outer instance" test, with no notion of nesting depth. If a nested group's own delimiter tag ever equalled its enclosing group's delimiter tag, the nested group's repeated delimiter fields would be mistaken for new outer-instance boundaries and the outer slice would be split incorrectly (the extent walk would still be correct; only the splitter would err). **This configuration does not occur in any shipped FIX dictionary** (Fable audit 2026-07-08: 0 nested/parent delimiter collisions across all 6 group-bearing vendored dicts). NOTE the earlier rationale that "the wire itself would be ambiguous" is **overstated** — `consume_group_extent` decodes such a collision *correctly* via declared counts, so the wire is decidable; only the flat splitter errs. The "impossible" is therefore a **convention of the shipped XMLs**, not a structural guarantee (confirmed: every real-dict nested/parent delimiter pair censused by 063 is distinct; the real-dict guard `NestedGroupExtent.MultiEntryNestedExtentGuard` passes for exactly this reason, not by accident). Reproducing the gap requires a **hand-built, non-representative** membership forcing outer/nested delimiter collision (the documented synthetic scoping trick in `tests/wire/nested_group_extent_test.cpp`). **Unenforced for user/dialect dictionaries:** nothing in the loader, `as_table_view()`, or the public `table_view` mutators rejects a nested==parent delimiter collision, so a user-supplied dialect XML or hand-built `table_view` (both public APIs) CAN construct it and reach the splitter bug — hardening (pin + optional load-time guard) tracked in **issue #180**. **Status: genuine internal inconsistency (extent walk is nesting-aware, the splitter is not); unreachable via any SHIPPED dictionary but unenforced for user/dialect dicts — deferred as defense-in-depth, non-blocking.** **Fix (deferred follow-up):** make the splitter nesting-aware too (advance `k` via the same `consume_group_extent` recursion on a nested count before testing outer-delimiter boundaries) and fold the redundant flat cap loop into the same traversal. *(Gate B PR#176 r1, Codex finding #2, downgraded and waived at P3 by orchestrator triage (real-dict-unreachable); `OffsetTable::group_slices_status()` in `src/wire/offset_table.cpp`.)*


## Membership-aware C-ABI nested repeating-group read (065-cabi-nested-group-membership / #179)

### Limitations

**L-065-1 — [FIXED by 072-nested-group-hardening (2026-07-13) — the emitter view-mint (`emit_messages.cpp`) now pushes the nested group's own no_tag onto the RETURNED child view's STORED membership context (`child_ctx.group_ctx = ctx_.group_ctx.pushed(c)`), reconciling the typed path UP to the already-correct C-ABI cursor in `fixpp_group_get_nested_group` (`src/capi/message_read.cpp`) — never un-pushing the C-ABI. The `nested_group_slices` call-arg stays `ctx_.group_ctx` and `group_view::operator[]` stays a verbatim copy (no double-push). Verified by clean `_codegen` reconfigure + REGENERATING the checked-in read goldens `specs/003-dictionary-codegen/contracts/golden/{v44,v50sp2}_Messages.golden.hpp` (the emitter change adds the pushed-context lines at every nested-descent site; `codegen_determinism_test` pins the generated headers byte-for-byte against those goldens — the research D-B5 "no checked-in golden" claim was WRONG and corrected here; v42/vt11 read goldens + the 069 official builders golden are UNCHANGED, the change being read-accessor-only) + the mutation-proven depth-3 witness `nested_group_read_test.cpp::NestedGroupRead.Depth3TypedPushedContextResolvesGrandchildMemberNotBareFallback` (RED pre-fix, GREEN post-fix, 30/30 no regression). CORRECTED MODEL (supersedes the stale "depth-2 member read" framing below): depth-2 slicing is CORRECT; the defect is that the stored child-view context was too SHORT, so the first observable failure is slicing a depth-3 GRANDCHILD group (min reproducing depth = 3, not 2). The description below is retained for history.] a pre-existing typed-path context-threading gap at nesting depth ≥ 2, and the consequent depth-2 C-ABI-vs-typed divergence, are NOT fixed by 065 (which is depth-1 scoped, issue #179).** The generated typed nested accessor threads the parent group's context **unpushed** into `nested_group_slices` on a nested descent (`tools/codegen/fixpp-codegen/emit_messages.cpp` nested-descent site; `group_view::operator[]` copies `base_ctx_` verbatim without a `.pushed(nested_tag)`), so a **depth-2** typed read of a member `X` from a `539`-entry queries membership under the too-short path `[453]` for a group registered under `[453,539]` — a miss that degrades to the legacy bare-`no_tag` store (Defect-A-prone). This is **pre-existing** (062/063), independent of 065, and reachable only for genuinely doubly-nested reads. 065 deliberately stores the **arithmetically-correct pushed path** on its C-ABI nested cursor (`nested->group_ctx = parent->group_ctx.pushed(nested_tag)`) rather than mirror the typed path's bug (project "don't enshrine bugs" discipline), so at depth-2 the C-ABI resolves membership under the correct `[453,539]` while the typed path resolves under `[453]` — a genuine **C-ABI-vs-typed divergence with the C-ABI being the more-correct side**. This divergence is **INERT at depth-1** (065's scope; verified: the nested cursor's `group_ctx` is read only on a *further* descent — depth-1 field reads go through `scan_slice_for_tag` and never touch it) and SC-005 equivalence is explicitly bounded to depth-1. **Fix (deferred follow-up):** push the typed context on nested descent in the emitter (`.pushed(nested_tag)`) + a forced golden regen + a validator counterpart — feature-sized, out of #179's depth-1 scope. When that lands it must push the typed context (not un-push the C-ABI's), reconciling the two paths onto the correct full path. **Tracked as issue #183.** *(065 research Decision 7; decided 2026-07-10; `emit_messages.cpp` nested-descent site, `group_view.hpp` `operator[]`.)*

**L-065-2 — [ADDRESSED by 073-nested-read-arena-failloud (2026-07-13, #184) — the NESTED read is now FAIL-LOUD on both consumer paths. `OffsetTable::nested_group_slices` (both overloads) returns a status-bearing `nested_slices_result{span slices; bool alloc_failed}` whose `alloc_failed` ORs THREE arena-exhaustion origins at BOTH empty-returning exits: (a) `build_nested_subview → nullptr` (shell alloc), (b) the built sub-table's own `group_slices()` `catch(bad_alloc)`, and (c) the sub-table's ctor `build()` degrading to `status_ = out_of_memory` (found at implement; `build_status().error() == out_of_memory`, scoped to OOM only so malformed-data degradation stays not-failed). C-ABI (`message_read.cpp`) returns the existing `FIXPP_ERR_WIRE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` before the presence probe; the typed path surfaces `group_view::alloc_failed()` threaded by the emitter. Fail-loud-only (FR-009) — NO arena-sizing/growability change. Witnesses: `nested_group_slices_failloud_test.cpp` (wire, 3-mode introspection + 3-mutant matrix), `message_read_failloud_test.cpp` (C-ABI), `group_view_failloud_test.cpp` (typed), all wide-margin/introspection-pinned for cross-tier robustness. Top-level reads remain silent (L-073-1, deferred). The historical deferral text below is retained for context.] the membership-aware C-ABI nested read builds a sub-`OffsetTable` into the per-message parse arena, so a near-arena-cap nested-group message can silently truncate (empty span → `OK`/`nc=0`) under arena exhaustion — an extreme-edge silent-truncation, at PARITY with the already-shipped typed dispatch path, deferred as a fail-loud follow-up (Gate B PR #182 r1, Opus-triaged P3).** The old positional scanner sliced nested instances into a stack array (`stack_slices[256]`), never touching the arena. 065's delegation to `OffsetTable::nested_group_slices` → `build_nested_subview(..., resource(), ...)` builds a nested sub-table + slices from `parent_view->offsets().resource()` — on the SHIPPED dispatch path that is the session's fixed **16 KiB `null_memory_resource`-upstream** inbound parse arena (`session.cpp` `inbound_tv_`/parse arena; `pmr_arena_upstream.hpp`). If a pathological near-16-KiB nested-read message exhausts the arena, `build_nested_subview` returns `nullptr` → the 4-arg overload returns an empty span → the presence probe maps present-tag-but-empty to `FIXPP_ERR_OK`, `nc=0`, masking a genuinely present nested group as empty (a silent truncation, NOT a wrong value). **Why deferred, not a blocker:** (1) net-correctness massively positive — it replaces the ubiquitous, always-reachable silent-WRONG-VALUE defect L-063-2 (222 FIX44 / ~20k FIX50SP2 layouts) with an extreme-edge silent-truncation that needs arena exhaustion to trigger; (2) **exact parity with the already-shipped typed dispatch path** — the C++ typed nested descent (`group_view::operator[]` → the same `build_nested_subview(..., resource(), ...)`) routes into the same fixed arena and shipped in 062/066, so 065 introduces no risk class the shipped typed path does not already carry; (3) SC-005 equivalence holds even degraded (both C-ABI and typed paths yield empty under exhaustion). **Fix (deferred follow-up):** a fail-loud seam that distinguishes "empty because absent / count-0" from "empty because the sub-table allocation failed" — which requires widening the span-returning `nested_group_slices` to a status-bearing result (the very widening research Decision 6 / FR-009 deliberately declined for the in-scope unreachable-overflow case), applied symmetrically to the typed path for parity. ~~+ a larger/growable inbound arena~~ **[superseded by FR-009 (073, clarified 2026-07-13): the shipped fix is fail-loud-only — NO arena-sizing/growability change; a growable arena is itself a DoS vector, arena sizing deferred].** Feature-sized, out of #179's approved bundle. Cross-ref the fixed-arena silent-loss class (066 `group_slices()` reserve tightening, `feedback_fixed_arena_over_reserve_silent_loss_larger_stl`). **Tracked as issue #184.** *(Gate B PR #182 round 1, Opus triage `research/reviews/opus_pr182_1_triage.md`; decided 2026-07-10.)*

**L-073-1 — TOP-LEVEL (non-nested) group reads retain the same silent-truncation-on-arena-exhaustion that 073 fixed for the nested path; deliberately out of scope (FR-009).** 073 makes the **nested** sub-table read fail-loud (`group_view::alloc_failed()` / C-ABI `WIRE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`), but the public `OffsetTable::group_slices(no_tag)` stays an unchanged span-returning wrapper (`return group_slices_status(no_tag).slices;`) so every top-level caller is behaviorally identical. Consequently a top-level group read — `MessageView::group<>()` / the top-level C-ABI group getter, which call `group_slices()` directly — still degrades to an empty span on `group_slices_status()`'s `catch (std::bad_alloc const&)`, and the top-level `group_view` is constructed with the defaulted `alloc_failed = false`. This is the same fixed-arena silent-loss family as the 066 reserve-bound mitigation (`cc169700`) and is a distinct, pre-existing limitation from #184 / L-065-2 (which is specifically the *nested* sub-table path). Surfacing it would touch the top-level C-ABI group getter + `MessageView::group<>()` + new witnesses — unjustified scope-creep here; spec.md actively mandates the exclusion (FR-009). Deliberately deferred. **[SCOPE WIDENED — not weakened — by 082-structural-group-detection (2026-08-12): as of 082 this limitation also applies to FIX 4.0/4.1/4.2, whose top-level group reads were previously *unreachable* because those dictionaries registered zero groups. This row's text is not dictionary-scoped, so it was never false without this note — unlike L-066-1, which enumerates "the six group-registering dictionaries" and did go stale. It is recorded so the two siblings get symmetric treatment and a reader does not have to ask why one was widened and the other left alone.]** *(073 research §D8 / D2; decided 2026-07-13.)*

## FIX 4.0/4.1 dictionary loader legacy-type support (064-fix4041-legacy-types / D-004)

### Behaviors

- **B-064-1 — The XML loader accepts the two pre-canonical legacy field-type names `TIME` and `DATE` (FIX 4.0/4.1), resolving them via the same collapse table as the post-canonical FIX-5.0 aliases; the `[FIX50SP2 §3.3]` `field_data_type` enum is unchanged.** `TIME → field_data_type::UtcTimestamp`, `DATE → field_data_type::LocalMktDate` (`src/dictionary/xml_loader.cpp` `kFieldTypeTable`, the collapse block after the `TAGNUM`/`LOCALMKTTIME`/`XID`/`XIDREF` rows). This completes `[const §I.1]`'s all-nine-versions runtime-XML commitment (FIX 4.0/4.1 were the last two un-loadable versions). The relaxation is **global, not version-scoped** — consistent with the existing global collapse rows, a `FIX44.xml` using `type="DATE"` would now load; no vendored FIX 4.2+ file actually uses these names, so no vendored file's resolved typing changes. Every other field type (`INT`, `LENGTH`, `DATE`-adjacent `MONTHYEAR`/`DAYOFMONTH`, …) was already in-vocabulary. *(FR-001/002/003/007; research R2/R3/R5; witnesses `xml_loader_test.cpp::Fix40/Fix41LoadsLegacyTypes`, `lookup_test.cpp` FIX40/FIX41 rows.)*

### Limitations

- **L-064-1 — `DATE` is typed `LocalMktDate` — a deliberate stronger-typing DIVERGENCE from QuickFIX, which resolves `DATE` to `TYPE::Unknown` (no validation).** QuickFIX's `DataDictionary::XMLTypeToType` (SHA `19ef6a4c`, `src/C++/DataDictionary.cpp:678`) has **no** `DATE` branch → falls through to `TYPE::Unknown`, i.e. QuickFIX performs no type validation on `DATE` fields. fixpp instead maps `DATE → LocalMktDate` because the two `DATE`-typed fields (`TradeDate`, `FutSettDate`) are typed `LOCALMKTDATE` in every FIX 4.2+ canonical dict, giving our typed reads real date semantics. **This divergence is metadata-only and carries zero interop-rejection risk:** `field_type_from_data_type` (`include/fixpp/dict/field_type.hpp`) collapses **both** `LocalMktDate` and `UtcTimestamp` (and `UtcDateOnly`, `DialectExtension`, `default`) to the same coarse `field_type::String` that the Phase-1 validator consumes, so no date/timestamp value-format check is keyed on the fine-grained enum — fixpp rejects no message value that QuickFIX's `TYPE::Unknown` path accepts. The divergence shows only in what `field_ref::type()` *reports*. The `TIME → UtcTimestamp` mapping AGREES with QuickFIX (`XMLTypeToType`'s `TIME` branch) and needs no divergence row. **Status: intentional (recorded design choice), not a defect.** *(FR-009; SC-005; research R3/R4; QuickFIX `DataDictionary::XMLTypeToType`.)*

## 061-typed-app-messages (typed application-message write shape-oracle — 5 exemplar builders + `wire::body_builder`, 2026-07-08)

061-slim delivers a **write shape-oracle**: 5 hand-written exemplar builders (NewOrderSingle 35=D / ExecutionReport 35=8 / OrderCancelReject 35=9 / NewOrderList 35=E / AllocationReport 35=AS, all `fixpp::v44`) on a shared `wire::body_builder`, each anchored to a checked-in QuickFIX-authored body-only golden + a dict-aware round-trip witness. It is the prerequisite (shape-oracle + `body_builder`) for the follow-on FR-015a codegen writer-emitter, NOT its implementation. Spec: `specs/061-typed-app-messages/`.

### Behaviors

- **B-061-1 — `wire::body_builder` emits the application BODY ONLY (leading `35=<MsgType>\x01` then business fields; NEVER framing tags `8/9/34/49/52/56/10` — INV-2); the engine stamps the session header + checksum trailer at frame time.** Repeating groups are emitted count-precedence (`No<Group>=<N>` then N instances) with LIFO nesting; group grammar is fail-closed at `commit()` (INV-5) against an **author-supplied `delimiter_tag`** (no dictionary lookup — `body_builder` is a `wire→core` primitive, no `wire→dictionary` edge), rejecting an empty instance or a non-delimiter-first instance, mirroring the C-ABI `validate_group_grammar`. Decimals canonical via `decimal_t::format` (INV-3). *(FR-001/002/004/005; INV-2/3/5; `include/fixpp/wire/body_builder.hpp`; witnesses `tests/wire/test_body_builder.cpp`, `tests/session/test_exemplar_roundtrip.cpp`.)*
- **B-061-2 — `body_builder` accumulates its intermediate entry tree with ZERO GLOBAL HEAP: an internal fixed member buffer (`kArenaCap=16384 B`) + a `std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource` with a NULL upstream, so arena exhaustion throws → caught → fail-closed typed error (INV-4, `out` untouched); the serialized body stays capped at `kBodyCap=3800 B`.** This mirrors the C-ABI `OutboundAccumulator` arena model and preserves the 020 builders' self-imposed no-heap guarantee (`Builder_NoHeap_CountingResource`, `[const §VIII.5]` — which binds only the inbound parse→fromApp path, not outbound builders). Pinned by the global-`operator new` counter test `tests/wire/test_body_builder.cpp::BodyBuilder.NoGlobalHeap_CountingNew`. *(Decision 4, amended implement-time 2026-07-08 by user ruling — data-model §1 / research Decision 4; [[feedback_monotonic_arena_percall_pmr_vector_leaks]].)*
- **B-061-3 — the 5 exemplar builders emit business fields in QuickFIX / FIX44-dictionary order to byte-match their external goldens under `shape_oracle_profile()` (which excludes only framing `{8,9,10,34,52}`, matching every business field incl. `TransactTime(60)` verbatim).** For the two refactored builders (D/8), this CHANGES the field order from their legacy 020 non-ascending emission to ascending (SC-001 golden-match overrides byte-identity to 020; the 020 read tests are order-insensitive and stay green — value-preserving). Enum/char domains (e.g. `Side(54)`=`'1'/'2'`) are hand-validated per-exemplar across all builders that carry the field (D/8/E/AS); generic enum-range tables are out of scope (→ FR-015a). *(FR-002/003; SC-001; `src/session/business_messages.cpp`; tasks.md T013/T014 CORRECTION.)*
- **B-061-4 — `wire::MessageView` is MOVE-ONLY (copy ctor/assignment `= delete`d); constructing a `MessageView` binds its `OffsetTable` to a per-message arena and copying it would silently LEAK on nested reads.** Surfaced by the 061 read scaffold (originally `return *mv` = a copy): a `MessageView` copy runs `std::pmr`'s `select_on_container_copy_construction`, which returns a DEFAULT-constructed `polymorphic_allocator` (→ `new_delete_resource`), re-rooting `table_`'s allocator OFF the arena. Its lazily-built nested sub-`OffsetTable`s (placement-new'd, reclaimed wholesale with the arena, never individually destructed — `offset_table.cpp build_nested_subview`) then allocate from the global heap and are never freed — an ASan-LeakSanitizer leak on every nested typed read. **Move-CONSTRUCTION preserves the source arena allocator (pmr move-construction adopts it), so parse results (`expected_t<MessageView>`) still flow by move.** Move-**assignment** is also `= delete`d (gate-b/r1 RC#1): `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator` does NOT propagate on container move-assignment, so `mv = std::move(parsed)` would keep the target's (possibly default-rooted) allocator and reopen the identical leak class via a different path — a compile-time-enforced `static_assert` regression pin (`tests/wire/parser_index_test.cpp`) confirms `MessageView` is move-constructible but not move-assignable. The C++ typed-read/parser/C-ABI production paths never copied or move-assigned a `MessageView` (compiler-verified caller census: only 6 pre-existing wire *tests* copied, now moved; zero sites move-assign). *(061 verify L1; ASan; `include/fixpp/wire/parser.hpp` MessageView special members; witnesses `tests/session/test_exemplar_{read,roundtrip}.cpp` under ASan.)*

### Limitations

- **L-061-1 — [RESOLVED by 082-structural-group-detection (2026-08-12, PR #261) — CLOSES issue #196.** The exemplar this row said was blocked is landed: `tests/session/test_082_v42_nested_exemplar_roundtrip.cpp` builds a **two-level nested** `fixpp::v42` `MassQuote` — `NoQuoteSets(296)` → `NoQuoteEntries(295)` — and byte-matches `tests/session/golden/v42_mass_quote.fix`, a golden authored by a **real QuickFIX-cpp v1.16.0** (generator checked in at `tools/quickfix_v42_exemplar_golden/`), then reads it back through the regenerated v42 read tier with both group levels enumerated. The golden is an INDEPENDENT oracle — not produced by fixpp — so agreement is evidence rather than tautology, and both legs are required: leg 1 alone passes if the reader is broken, leg 2 alone passes if writer and reader share a compensating bug. ⚠️ **`UnderlyingSymbol(311)` is load-bearing and must not be "aligned away"**: FIX 4.2 marks it `required='Y'` inside `NoQuoteSets` and FIX 4.4 does not, so this golden differs from the v44 `mass_quote.fix` sibling by exactly that field. The FR-015a prerequisite named below is discharged.] **no v42 (market-data) grouped/nested write exemplar is expressible: v42 codegen emits ZERO typed repeating-group accessors (same root cause as L-063-1 — FIX40/41/42 type their group-count fields as legacy XML `INT`, not `NUMINGROUP`, so `Dictionary::as_table_view()` + the codegen emitter register zero groups).** All 5 exemplars are therefore forced to `fixpp::v44`. Expressing a grouped market-data write (e.g. a `NoQuoteSets`-bearing message in v42) is blocked until v42 group codegen exists, which is an **FR-015a prerequisite**, not 061 work. *(spec Out-of-Scope; Clarifications 2026-07-08; [[project_061_typed_app_messages]]; cross-ref L-063-1.)*
- **L-061-2 — the 5 exemplar builders are REPRESENTATIVE shape-oracles, not full-field: each sets all message-level required fields + the identifying first field of each required component + enough optionals to exercise every field TYPE and the full group/nesting SHAPE, NOT every optional field.** Full-field coverage, the remaining ~28 OFFICIAL A/M/P builders, and all-version coverage are the follow-on FR-015a / FR-015b features; the 5 catalogue rows (A-001/A-002/A-006/A-007/P-003) therefore carry 061 evidence but remain `backlog` for full coverage until FR-015a closes them. *(FR-002/FR-010; data-model §2 "Representative shape-oracle rule"; the 020 "minimal fields" precedent.)*

## 066-dict-backed-inbound-parse (dictionary-backed inbound receive parse, 2026-07-09)

066 threads the session's configured dictionary into the inbound receive parse (`Session::parse_and_dispatch_`, the single parse site shared by admin and app dispatch), which had been dictionary-FREE: every inbound-dispatched `MessageView` (C-ABI and C++ typed) carried no group membership, so a repeating group's last instance absorbed every subsequent body field on the real dispatch path — the root cause behind issue #179, broader than #179's C-ABI-nested framing (it also affected top-level groups and the C++ typed path, not only the nested C-ABI cursor). Clone (`fixpp_msg_clone`) and `reify` propagate the same membership (FR-007), so a clone/reify handle reads identically to its dict-backed source. Spec: `specs/066-dict-backed-inbound-parse/`.

### Behaviors

- **B-066-1 — inbound repeating-group reads are now membership-bounded on the SHIPPED dispatch path (both C-ABI and C++ typed), matching QuickFIX/J's strict in-group behavior; this is an INTENDED behavior change (permissive → strict), not merely a bug fix.** A counterparty field inside a group instance that is not a declared member of that group in its context now terminates the instance at that field (`OffsetTable::consume_group_extent` breaks on the first non-member) — both at the TRAILING end (a field after the group is no longer absorbed by the last instance) and, more subtly, INTERIOR to an instance (an undeclared tag between two declared members truncates the instance right there, so a declared member appearing AFTER the undeclared tag is now absent even though it was present on the wire). Before 066 this was permissive: an unknown in-group field was silently tolerated and the last instance's extent ran to end-of-message, returning `FIXPP_ERR_OK` + a wrong value instead of `FIXPP_ERR_TAG_NOT_FOUND`/absent. **Extension story**: the presently-shipped path for a superset counterparty (e.g. a FIX-Latest / Orchestra EP addition) is to keep the loaded dictionary CURRENT — Orchestra/EP additions declared with group membership are strict-bounding-inclusive by construction ([[project_orchestra_fix_latest_direction]]); the `dialect_overlay` config knob (the `D-009` row in `spec/feature-catalogue.md`) is the PLANNED membership-extension path but remains **`backlog`/unshipped** — it is NOT a currently-functional escape hatch for an undeclared in-group field. Top-level unknown-tag tolerance is unaffected (still indexed + `get(tag)`-readable) — only group extents became strict. Proven directly on the shipped path (not inferred from a `Parser<Index>{dict}` unit-tier test) by `tests/session/test_066_group_membership_red_test.cpp::GroupMembershipRed.TrailingFieldAbsentFromLastInstance` (trailing) and `::InteriorUndeclaredTagTruncatesInstance` (interior) — both real `Session::parse_and_dispatch_` witnesses, RED before 066 and GREEN after — plus the C-ABI mirror `tests/capi/dict066_group_membership_red_test.cpp::GroupMembershipCapiRed.TrailingFieldAbsentFromLastInstance`. *(FR-001/003/008; contract C1/C3 `specs/066-dict-backed-inbound-parse/contracts/inbound-parse.md`; Edge Cases; Clarifications 2026-07-09.)*

### Limitations

- **L-066-1 — [RESOLVED by 082-structural-group-detection (2026-08-12, PR #261) — CLOSES issue #196.** FIX 4.0/4.1/4.2 register groups structurally now (4 / 7 / 18 respectively), so their inbound group reads are **membership-correct**, not `TYPE_MISMATCH`/absent. **066's membership-correctness claims (SC-001/FR-001/FR-003) are hereby WIDENED from six dictionaries to all nine** — FIX40 / FIX41 / FIX42 / FIX43 / FIX44 / FIX50 / FIX50SP1 / FIX50SP2 / FIXT.1.1 (plus Orchestra FIX Latest at the read tier). The enumeration below is left as written for the historical record; **read this bracket as the operative scope.** ⚠️ **Citation correction, twice over.** This row cited a specific `dictionary.cpp` line for the NumInGroup gate: that citation was already stale before 082, and 082's own spec text (FR-019/T050) directed refreshing it to another specific line — **which was also wrong**, landing on a 083 test-seam comment about an atomic call counter, not a detection gate. Re-pointing a stale anchor at a plausible twin is worse than leaving it stale, so the honest correction is this: **the NumInGroup gate no longer exists.** The registration decision is now `group_first_field(legacy_no_tag)` inside `as_table_view()`'s bare loop (in `src/dictionary/dictionary.cpp`) and the sibling context-scoped loop. ⚠️ Also note the parse/addressing half of this change ships **UNCONDITIONALLY** — `session.cpp` builds `inbound_tv_` in `open()` regardless of `validate_inbound_messages` — while the newly-reachable group-membership strictness rides the **existing** `validate_inbound_messages` opt-in; see the FR-006c row.] **FIX 4.0/4.1/4.2 sessions become strict-but-GROUP-BLIND under dict-backing (inherits L-063-1): their inbound group reads flip from present-but-positionally-wrong to `TYPE_MISMATCH`/absent, not to membership-correct.** These three dictionaries type their group-count fields with the legacy XML `INT` (not `NUMINGROUP`), so `Dictionary::as_table_view()` (via what was then its NumInGroup gate) registers ZERO groups for them — the same root cause as L-063-1/L-061-1. Once the inbound parse is dict-backed (066), a FIX40/41/42 session's `fixpp_msg_get_group`/typed group query on what IS a real wire-level repeating group now returns `FIXPP_ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH`/absent rather than a membership-bounded read, because `as_table_view()` never registered it as a group at all. 066's membership-correctness claims (SC-001/FR-001/FR-003) are therefore SCOPED to the six group-registering dictionaries: FIX43 / FIX44 / FIX50 / FIX50SP1 / FIX50SP2 / FIXT.1.1. Structural INT-count group registration (the L-063-1-deferred fix) remains out of scope for 066. **Status: documented scope carve-out (tied to L-063-1), not a 066 defect.** **[UNCHANGED by 083-group-delimiter-resolution (2026-08-01), stated explicitly rather than left to inference.** 083 fixes *which* delimiter a registered context resolves; it does not change *whether* an `INT`-typed count tag registers at all, so this carve-out survives 083 verbatim. 083's T013 corroborated the mechanism to source — see the 083 bracket on L-063-1. Nor does 083's new fail-closed load path (FR-023: a declared group in the checked set that resolves no delimiter throws) reach these contexts: they are excluded from the checked set *by the same `NumInGroup` gate*, measured at exactly 55 contexts across the ten dictionaries and pinned as a tripwire so the exclusion cannot silently grow. #196 remains the fix. **← SUPERSEDED 2026-08-12: #196 LANDED (082). Those 55 contexts now register, the tripwire was inverted rather than deleted (`DelimiterCensus.IntTypedCountTagContextsAreExactlyFiftyFiveAndNowRegistered`), and the `NumInGroup` gate this paragraph reasons about no longer exists. Read the RESOLVED bracket at the head of this row as operative; this 083-era text is kept verbatim as the audit trail.**]** *(FR-001/003/008; spec.md Edge Cases; contract C1 Scope note; cf. L-063-1, L-061-1.)*

**Release note (066):** Inbound repeating-group reads (C-ABI `fixpp_group_*`/`fixpp_msg_get_group` and the C++ typed flyweights) are now dictionary-membership-bounded on the SHIPPED receive path — a group instance containing an undeclared field (trailing or interior) is correctly truncated at that field instead of silently absorbing subsequent bytes, matching QuickFIX/J's strict in-group semantics. This is an **interop-visible, intended behavior change** (permissive → strict); keep the loaded dictionary current for any counterparty extension (see B-066-1's extension story — `dialect_overlay`/D-009 is planned, not yet shipped). Scoped to group-registering dictionaries (FIX43/44/50/50SP1/50SP2/FIXT.1.1); FIX 4.0/4.1/4.2 sessions become strict-but-group-blind (`TYPE_MISMATCH`) for group queries — a pre-existing scope carve-out (L-063-1/L-066-1). **[SUPERSEDED by 082-structural-group-detection (2026-08-12, PR #261): the carve-out in the preceding sentence is RETIRED. All nine QuickFIX-XML dictionaries now register groups structurally, so FIX 4.0/4.1/4.2 group queries are membership-bounded like every other version, and this release note's strict-semantics scope is **all nine**, not six.]**

## 067-codegen-writer-emitter (codegen WRITE surface — `build_<Msg>` + `validate_<Msg>` for all 33 OFFICIAL FIX44 MsgTypes, 2026-07-10)

067 (FR-015a-lite) adds a codegen writer-emitter: a generated `build_<Msg>(std::span<std::byte> out, const <Msg>Args&) noexcept` over `wire::body_builder` plus a separate required-presence `validate_<Msg>` for every OFFICIAL FIX44 application MsgType, emitted into `_codegen/include/fixpp/v44/Builders.hpp`. Exact-set completeness over the 33 MsgTypes (SC-001); the 5 exemplars (D/8/9/E/AS) byte-identical to the frozen 061 hand-builders + QuickFIX goldens (SC-002). Scoped to the v44 representative namespace (FR-010/SC-001); full-field/all-version (FR-015b) is future. No runtime/`Dictionary`/`GroupRef`/C-ABI/Python change (FR-009). Spec: `specs/067-codegen-writer-emitter/`.

### Limitations

- **L-067-1 — `validate_<Msg>` derives required-ness from each field's own `required` attribute (IR `FieldRef.rule`), not from component-usage context. ⚠️ RE-ASSESSED 2026-07-18 (Fable): the headline example is QuickFIX-PARITY behavior, NOT a divergence — DEFER as a non-defect. The real, reproduced bug in the same required-ness-derivation family is the GROUP-scope leak tracked as fixpp#201, not this component-scope description.** FIX dictionaries model many mandatory fields via a `<component required='Y'>` USAGE tag while the component-internal `<field>` is `required='N'` — e.g. `Instrument required='Y'` on NewOrderSingle (35=D), but `Symbol(55) required='N'` inside `Instrument`. The loader carries only the component-internal required-ness into `FieldRef.rule`, so `Symbol(55)` lands Optional and `validate_NewOrderSingle` does NOT reject a `Symbol(55)`-absent message. **Re-assessment:** QuickFIX composes required-ness as **AND** (field `required='Y'` AND component `required='Y'`, `DataDictionary.cpp addXMLComponentFields`); with `Symbol(55) required='N'` inside `Instrument`, QuickFIX ALSO derives Symbol Optional and ALSO accepts a Symbol-absent NewOrderSingle — verified against the shipped `libfixpp_dictionary.a` and upstream QuickFIX. **fixpp matches the reference engine here**; the "under-rejection" is only vs the FIX paper spec's intent, and **no vendored dictionary carries the data to recover it** (FIX44 has 0 component-internal `required='Y'` direct fields; Orchestra models Symbol optional). Implementing the originally-described "fix" would MANUFACTURE false-rejects QuickFIX does not perform. **Actionable defect ⇒ fixpp#201:** the read-side validator's message-level required set is instead contaminated by group-scoped `required='Y'` members (`xml_loader.cpp` group-branch leak) → false-rejects conforming traffic + a per-instance under-enforcement hole; L-067-1's own measured over-require surface is ~6 sites on two rare v50sp2/vlatest messages, folded into the #201 fix. See `research/G19-fix-fpml-iso20022/fable-assessments/6.1-L067-1-required-presence-scope.md`. *(067 spec Edge Case "Component-usage required-ness NOT enforced" / SC-004(a); 067 close-out 2026-07-10, PR #185; re-assessed 2026-07-18, Fable 6.1 / fixpp#201.)*
- **L-067-2 — a `Data` field (Length+Data coupled) carrying any byte outside `0x20–0x7E` cannot be emitted through the generated builder: `body_builder`'s string path admits only printable ASCII (`is_printable`, `src/wire/body_builder.cpp`), so the coupled Length+Data member accepts ASCII text only — no control bytes and no non-ASCII content (`0x80–0xFF`) either.** 067 models a Length+Data pair (e.g. `EncodedTextLen(354)`/`EncodedText(355)`, `RawDataLength(95)`/`RawData(96)`) as ONE coupled `std::optional<string_view>` in `<Msg>Args` with the Length auto-derived at emit time (FR-007a), routed through `body_builder`'s string path — which rejects any value containing a byte outside `0x20–0x7E` before a byte reaches `out`. ASCII-only Data IS supported; anything else — binary content, and non-ASCII text such as `EncodedText(355)` under `MessageEncoding(347)`, the field's whole purpose — is cut for v1.0. ⚠️ **Not pinned for `Data` fields:** `tests/session/test_067_builder_failclosed.cpp`'s SOH case is on `ClOrdID(11)`, a `STRING` field, and its only `Data` case is ASCII, so no test fails if the guard's range moves for a `Data` member; the rewrite is part of fixpp #418 (`body_builder` exposes no arbitrary-bytes API). **Fix (deferred follow-up):** a `body_builder` arbitrary-bytes emit path for coupled Length+Data — a v1.x demand-driven follow-on. *(067 FR-007a / spec Out-of-Scope "Binary Data-field content"; `tests/session/test_067_builder_failclosed.cpp`; 067 close-out; decided 2026-07-10; PR #185.)*
- **L-067-3 — the grouped QuickFIX goldens `golden/{market_data_snapshot,market_data_incremental,mass_quote}.fix` (T018) are checked in but NOT yet consumed by a byte-compare test — they are insurance artifacts (research R5), available for future byte-oracle wiring, not an active assertion.** 067 T018 generated the paired W/X discriminator goldens (`NoMDEntries` delimiter 269 vs 279) + the deep-nested `NoQuoteEntries` mass-quote golden as offline-harness anchors, but the shipped round-trip witness `tests/session/test_067_builder_roundtrip.cpp` does not read them (no golden-file comparison call); the active byte-equality assertion is the 5-exemplar shape-oracle (D/8/9/E/AS, SC-002), which these grouped goldens are NOT part of. **Fix (deferred follow-up):** wire a grouped byte-oracle test that byte-compares generated W/X/i output against these `.fix` anchors — available whenever grouped byte-equality coverage is demanded. *(067 tasks.md T018 note / research R5; 067 close-out; decided 2026-07-10; PR #185.)*

## 069-v44-all-families (widen the 067 writer-emitter from 33 OFFICIAL to ALL 83 in-scope v44 application messages, 2026-07-11)

069 widens the 067 codegen writer-emitter's selection predicate from the 33-message `kOfficial33` allow-list to all 83 in-scope (`msgcat='app'` minus the N-002/N-003 `{BE,BF}` session-FSM pair) FIX44 application messages, default-on via `FIXPP_CODEGEN_V44_FAMILIES=all` (opt-down to `official`=33 for cost-sensitive builds). The 33 OFFICIAL messages stay byte-identical (SC-003); every emitted builder is proven by a differential round-trip against the independent runtime-XML path (all 83, SC-002); group-shape parity is additionally anchored via 8 external QuickFIX-golden exemplars (SC-006) — not all 83, since seeding every required group across all 83 messages is optional hardening (contract C4), not a shipped guarantee. Spec: `specs/069-v44-all-families/`.

### Limitations

- **L-069-1 — [STILL OPEN after 075-live-wire-enum-validation (2026-07-14) — explicitly restated, not silently absorbed. 075 is scoped entirely to the `table_view`/`wire::dictionary_driven_validator` runtime read-tier path (the LIVE inbound wire validation gate under `SessionConfig::validate_inbound_messages`); it does NOT touch codegen or the generated `validate_<Msg>` builder-side validators this entry describes — a DIFFERENT, unrelated surface. A message built and self-validated via `build_<Msg>`/`validate_<Msg>` still does not enum-check; only messages arriving on the LIVE inbound wire path with strict validation enabled do (via 075). This gap remains future codegen work, non-goal of 075.] generated validators for the 50 newly-covered families enforce required-field presence + type conformance only; enum value-domain is UNBACKED, identical in kind to the 33 OFFICIAL's existing scope.** `validate_<Msg>` for every one of the 83 in-scope messages (the 33 carried over from 067 plus the 50 069 adds) checks that a required field is present and its wire representation type-conforms (e.g. an `int`-typed field parses as an integer), but does NOT check that a field whose FIX type is an enumerated code set (e.g. `Side(54)`, `OrdType(40)`) carries one of its dictionary-declared allowed values — a validator accepting an out-of-domain enum value on any of the 83 typed builders is expected behavior under this contract, not a defect. 069 does not introduce this gap; it widens the surface on which the pre-existing 067 limitation applies, from 33 messages to all 83. Enum value-domain validation remains future codegen work (tied to any future `emit_enums`), not scoped to 069. *(FR-013; SC-007; contract C5 "Validator scope contract"; feature 069-v44-all-families; cf. 067's C5-equivalent scope, `test_067_builder_failclosed.cpp` precedent.)*

## 071 — mid-session ResetSeqNumFlag(141) reset originator (S-032 residual) — DEFERRED, NOT BUILT (2026-07-12)

Feature 071 investigated the one *proactive, on-demand, mid-session* half of `ResetSeqNumFlag(141)` (S-032 residual) and, after `/specify`→`/clarify`→`/plan`→Gate A (2 rounds), **deferred it with no engine code** (user decision). Decision record: `specs/071-midsession-seqnum-reset/DECISION.md`. The reactive halves — received-141 (S-017/024) + connect-time `reset_on_logon` (030/032) — remain the shipped, supported way to reset sequence numbers.

### Limitations

- **L-071-1 — on-demand mid-session sequence reset (in-band OR reconnect-based) is NOT shipped; only start-of-session reset is.** An application cannot reset a *live* session's sequence numbers to 1 on demand. Shipped: construct with `reset_on_logon=true` → the single connect Logon resets both sides to 1 (start-of-session only). Both paths to on-demand mid-session reset were costed in feature 071 and deferred: **(A) in-band live-socket reset** (send Logon(141=Y) on the open transport — interop-valid vs QuickFIX) requires 6 pieces of custom concurrency machinery (new Active→LogonSent FSM edge; two-edge `onLogout` model so a failed reset does not die silently; ack-arm outbound-restore predicate change vs the brittle `peek==2` inference; liveness-loop generation guard; LogonSent inbound-tolerance for in-flight peer heartbeats; outbound-emit quiescence so a suspended `send()`/heartbeat cannot emit a stale-seq frame). **(B) reconnect-based reset** (logout+reconnect+ResetOnLogon — how QuickFIX/fix8 actually do 24-hour reset) requires the **unshipped, explicitly-deferred reconnect-after-drop** capability (`run_connect_loop` in `src/session/engine.cpp` — the connect loop does one connect+pump then returns; `reconnect_policy` is initial-connect retry only), plus a public reconnect trigger (none: `open()` single-use, `Engine::start()` once-only) and a reachable one-shot `reset_on_logon` toggle (none: `cfg_` is a private by-value copy). **Status: deliberate deferral, not a defect.** The broadly-valuable adjacent investment is reconnect-after-drop / session-recovery (Path-B prerequisite; session-recovery "row 400" family). *(S-032; feature 071 DECISION.md; Gate A reviews `research/reviews/{codex,opus}_071-*`; decided 2026-07-12.)*

## 074-orchestra-native-reader (native FIX Orchestra `fixr:repository` reader → FIX Latest / EP303, 2026-07-14)

Feature 074 adds `dict::OrchestraLoader` — a pugixml-based native reader for the official FIX Orchestra machine-readable standard (`OrchestraFIXLatest.xml`, EP303) — producing a runtime `Dictionary` under the new distinct `session_version::vlatest` (read/dictionary tier only; wire application version maps to the existing `v50sp2`, no distinct ApplVerID). Sibling to `XmlLoader`; zero C-ABI change; XmlLoader and the nine QuickFIX dicts untouched. Codeset values+descriptions are preserved via an additive tag-keyed enum side-table on `dict_metadata_handle` + `Dictionary::enum_values(tag)` (**[STALE by 075-live-wire-enum-validation, 2026-07-14] — was "orthogonal to the still-stubbed `enum_valid`" at 074-close-out time; `enum_valid` is no longer a stub, see `## 075-live-wire-enum-validation` below**).

### Limitations

- **L-074-1 — interim `v50sp2` registry-slot coexistence (FIX50SP2 + FIX Latest cannot share one `version_registry`).** FIX Latest and real FIX 5.0SP2 share the single `application_version::v50sp2` `version_registry` slot (`session_to_application(vlatest)→v50sp2`; the `application_version` enum is deliberately **not** re-keyed in this feature — deferred per the spike RECONCILE, `orchestra-fix-latest-spike-and-plan.md` L145-146). Until the ApplExtID(1156)=303-aware registry re-keying lands (follow-on, `REMAINING-WORK.md` row 4b), an `EngineConfig`/`version_registry` MUST NOT carry **both** a FIX50SP2 and a FIX Latest dictionary at once: the **FR-010 fail-loud guard** (`version_registry.cpp` ctor — release-effective `std::abort` with an `"FR-010"` diagnostic, since the ctor is `noexcept`) rejects that combination rather than silently dropping one (the QuickFIX-style last-writer-wins previously documented in that same ctor). **Single-dictionary use is unaffected** — FIX Latest alone, or FIX50SP2 alone, registers and resolves normally. This is the standards-correct wire mapping (FIX Latest's on-wire application version IS 5.0SP2/ApplVerID 9; its real differentiator is ApplExtID(1156)=303, whose modelling is the scheduled follow-on), not a dictionary-identity collision — at the `session_version` layer `vlatest` is fully distinct from all nine legacy identities. Pinned by `OrchestraFR010Guard.{BothDictsFailLoud,SingleDictConfigsSucceed}`. *(SC-005/FR-010; the `L-074-1` bullet in `specs/074-orchestra-native-reader/spec.md`'s Known Limitations section; decided 2026-07-13/14.)*

## 075-live-wire-enum-validation (dictionary-driven live-wire enum-value domain checking, 2026-07-14)

Feature 075 makes `table_view::enum_valid()` real: a dictionary-driven, store-driven check of a field's wire value against its dictionary-declared `<value enum="…">` code set, live across **all ten** supported dictionaries (the nine QuickFIX-XML versions FIX 4.0–5.0SP2 plus FIX Latest via `session_version::vlatest`; `XmlLoader` now parses declared codesets into the same additive enum store 074 introduced for `OrchestraLoader`, previously EMPTY for all nine legacy dictionaries). This discharges the long-standing Phase-1 `enum_valid`→`true` stub (L-041-1, retired above) and turns live the dead `SessionRejectReason=5` enum arm. Multi-value fields (`ExecInst(18)` and 7 other FIX44 tags; up to 10 on FIX50/SP1) are tokenized on a single space with every token checked independently. The feature also threads the offending tag out of `Validator::validate()` for the first time (T020a), so a validate-driven `Reject(35=3)` now carries `RefTagID(371)`. Rides on the **existing** `SessionConfig::validate_inbound_messages` flag (default `false`, unchanged) — no new config surface. Spec: `specs/075-live-wire-enum-validation/`.

### Behaviors

- **B-075-1 — Strict-validating sessions now reject out-of-domain enum values they silently accepted before.** Under `SessionConfig::validate_inbound_messages=true` (default `false`, unaffected), every field the validator's Step-1 walk yields — header, body, trailer, and repeating-group members at every depth — is checked against the loaded dictionary's declared code set. A violation Rejects with `Reject(35=3, SessionRejectReason(373)=5)`, `RefTagID(371)` = the offending tag, and never reaches the application; in `LogonReceived`/`Active` it consumes the seqnum only when it carried the expected one (B-423-1, fixpp#423). This is now live on **all ten** supported dictionaries, not just FIX Latest — representative affected tags: `Side(54)`, `OrdType(40)`, `ExecInst(18)`, `MsgType(35)`, `EncryptMethod(98)`, `PossDupFlag(43)`, and every other enum-backed field (FIX44 alone declares 245 such fields / 1708 codes; FIX50SP2 668/5565). At the default (flag `false`) this is a byte-identical no-op. *(FR-002/FR-003/FR-006; `table_view::enum_valid()`; witnesses `tests/wire/validator_enum_domain_test.cpp`, `tests/session/test_enum_validation_logon.cpp`.)*
- **B-075-2 — DV-3: fixpp enum-checks repeating-group members at every depth; QuickFIX does not check them at all.** fixpp's Step-1 walk is a raw-frame byte scan with no group awareness, so it yields group members (any nesting depth) exactly like top-level fields — an out-of-domain enum on a party-role, leg-side, or MD-entry-type field inside a group now Rejects/5 with `RefTagID` = the member tag. QuickFIX's `iterate()` never descends into `m_groups`, so the identical value passes its validator entirely. This is a **deliberate, declared divergence** — fixpp is stricter and more correct here, not a defect to be matched. *(FR-023; register row DV-3; witness `tests/wire/validator_enum_domain_test.cpp` T023.)*
- **B-075-3 — DV-4: `SettlLocation(166)=US` (and any other real ISO country code) now rejects on FIX 4.1 / FIX 4.2.** Those two dictionaries declare the codeset literal `"ISO Country Code"` — a prose documentation placeholder, not a wire literal — alongside 6 real codes (`CED`, `DTC`, `EUR`, `FED`, `PNY`, `PTC`). A real ISO country code like `US`/`GB`/`DE` is therefore out-of-domain and now Rejects/5. **QuickFIX rejects identically** (it declares the same placeholder), so this is parity-correct, not a fixpp-only regression — but it is an operator-visible behavior change on conformant real-world traffic that required a deliberate decision (accept-and-document, not a carve-out: a carve-out would manufacture a divergence from the reference engine and invent an unprincipled heuristic). Pinned as an exact-set gate (`SC-011`): the space-bearing declared codes across all ten dictionaries are exactly `{FIX41:166, FIX42:166} = "ISO Country Code"` — any addition/removal/edit fails the build. *(FR-022; register row DV-4.)*
- **B-075-4 — DV-5: on a value that fails QuickFIX's TYPE CONVERTOR, fixpp rejects with reason 5 where QuickFIX rejects with reason 6 — both engines REJECT, only the reason differs.** QuickFIX's `iterate()` runs `checkValidFormat` (the field's type convertor, `DataDictionary.cpp:171`) immediately BEFORE `checkValue` (the enum arm, `:172`); a value that fails the convertor throws `IncorrectDataFormat` (reason 6) and never reaches the enum arm. fixpp has no generic bad-format slot (its reason 6 is Float/decimal-precision-loss only), so the same value maps to reason 5. **The divergence class is "the wire value fails QuickFIX's type convertor" — NOT "the field is not a `STRING`."** It fires for an enum-backed `BOOLEAN` value outside `{Y,N}` (e.g. `PossDupFlag(43)=X`) and for an empty or multi-character `CHAR` value (e.g. empty `Side(54)=`) — cases fixpp's type arm does not replicate the same way. Every other out-of-domain value — including a single-character `CHAR` like `Side(54)=Z`, the headline case — passes the convertor, so both engines reach the enum arm and reject/5 identically. An operator diffing reject reasons against QuickFIX on a `BOOLEAN`/malformed-`CHAR` field will see 5-vs-6 here. *(FR-015; register row DV-5; discovered by the Phase-0.5 golden at T006 — five Gate A rounds missed it because every parity claim in the bundle cited line `:172`, one line below the actual answer.)*
- **B-075-5 — FIX 4.0 / FIX 4.1 strict validation, previously unusable (100% inbound rejection), now works.** `dictionaries/FIX40.xml` and `FIX41.xml` type `BeginString(8)` and `CheckSum(10)` as `CHAR` (faithfully vendored — QuickFIX's own `spec/FIX41.xml` says `CHAR` too), and fixpp's `Char` type arm demands `size()==1`; `8=FIX.4.1` is 7 bytes, so every FIX40/FIX41 message was rejected on tag 8 before reaching any other field. This was a **pre-existing bug**, not introduced by 075, and had never been caught — no test in the project's history had driven a FIX40/FIX41 message through `validate()` before 075's golden parity gate. **Fixed**: `XmlLoader`'s type resolution now mirrors QuickFIX's version-conditional rule (`DataDictionary.cpp:589-592`) — on FIX 4.0/4.1 dictionaries specifically (matched by `session_version`, not a major/minor numeric comparison, so FIXT.1.1's major=1/minor=1 is not mismatched), a `CHAR`-declared field is treated as `String`. **Consequence for operators**: on FIX 4.0 / FIX 4.1 dictionaries, ALL `CHAR`-typed fields are now treated as `String` for validation purposes (matching QuickFIX) — a behavior change in its own right, distinct from strict validation simply starting to work. No other dictionary is affected (FIX 4.2+ already declared `BeginString`/`CheckSum` as `STRING`); the vendored dictionary XML itself was NOT edited. *(Found + fixed at T044, user-dispositioned; witness `tests/wire/validator_legacy_char_type_test.cpp`.)*
- **B-075-6 — Reject(35=3) frames driven by dictionary validation now carry `RefTagID(371)` — including the pre-existing type-arm rejects, for free.** Previously `Validator::validate()` had no channel to report which tag failed, so `session.cpp` hardcoded `RejectDecision{reason, ref_tag_id=0}` and tag 371 was OMITTED from every validate-driven `Reject(35=3)` — a live interop gap versus QuickFIX, which does emit 371. `validate()` now threads the offending tag through its existing failure sites into `RejectDecision::ref_tag_id`; a strict-validating session's Reject now names the field that failed, for BOTH the new enum-arm rejects and the pre-existing (041-era) type-arm rejects. *(FR-006; T020a; witnesses `tests/wire/validator_enum_domain_test.cpp`, `tests/session/test_validate_gate_inbound.cpp` W2/W3/W4.)*
- **B-075-7 — A peer sending an out-of-domain admin enum cannot establish a session under strict validation.** fixpp validates inbound Logon before `interpret_logon()` (QuickFIX parity — `Session.cpp:1218-1231` validates before `nextLogon`), so a Logon carrying an out-of-domain admin enum (e.g. an undeclared `EncryptMethod(98)`) is Rejected with reason 5 and the session does NOT establish. An in-domain Logon establishes exactly as before. Bounded by the whole path remaining opt-in behind `validate_inbound_messages`. *(FR-013; witness `tests/session/test_enum_validation_logon.cpp`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-075-1 — fixpp has no SessionRejectReason=4 mapping, and its empty-value disposition is type-arm dependent, not enum-arm dependent.** Two related facts: **(1)** `reject_reason_map.hpp` emits only reasons `1`/`2`/`5`/`6`/`14` — there is no generic "tag specified without a value" (4) slot, so fixpp cannot match QuickFIX's default `NoTagValue`→reason-4 disposition for an empty field value. **(2)** Empty field values are deliberately EXCLUDED from the enum check (FR-008 disposition (a)) and fall through to `check_field_type` instead, so the disposition is **type-arm dependent**: an empty `Char` field (e.g. `Side(54)=`) Rejects/5 via the type arm's `size()!=1` guard (parity with QuickFIX's reject/6 by coincidence of outcome, not mechanism — DV-1); an empty `String` field (e.g. `ExecInst(18)=`) is **ACCEPTED** (the `String` type arm imposes no constraint) where QuickFIX rejects/5 — a genuine divergence (DV-2). Routing empty values through the enum check instead would not achieve parity (fact 1 means fixpp would emit 5 where QuickFIX's default emits 4, manufacturing a NEW divergence). **Status: deferred** — adding a reason-4 slot is session-reject-mapping work, not enum-domain work, and out of 075's scope. *(FR-008; register rows DV-1/DV-2; `reject_reason_map.hpp`; witness `tests/wire/validator_enum_domain_test.cpp` T022a.)*

## 076-fix-latest-typed-codegen (typed read/reify/args/validator tier for `fixpp::vlatest`, 2026-07-16)

Feature 076 generates the typed **read/reify/args/validator** codegen tier for all 181 FIX Latest (EP303) messages into a distinct `fixpp::vlatest` namespace, fed by 074's native `OrchestraLoader`. It is gated by the `FIXPP_CODEGEN_FIX_LATEST` CMake option (default ON) and is purely additive — the legacy `v42/v44/v50sp2/vt11` tiers are byte-identical with the option ON or OFF. Completeness is proven non-circularly (no QuickFIX peer) by a two-leg census: V-1 (an independent raw-`OrchestraFIXLatest.xml` walker ≡ the emitted per-message manifest) composed with V-1b (the manifest ≡ the shipped read classes' reachable field set). Spec: `specs/076-fix-latest-typed-codegen/`.

### Behaviors

- **B-076-1 — FIX Latest messages are typed-reifiable/readable/runtime-validatable in v1.0.** With `FIXPP_CODEGEN_FIX_LATEST=ON` (default), a developer generates the `fixpp::vlatest` tier and can reify any of the 181 FIX Latest messages via the universal `owning_<Msg>::from_view()/view()` path, read fields back field-for-field, and run per-message required/group-presence validation — exactly as for `fixpp::v44`'s read surface. Proven by an all-181 reify round-trip (zero skips) + the two-leg completeness census. At the read/dictionary tier this composes with 074 (`session_version::vlatest`) and 075 (dictionary-driven wire validation). *(FR-001(a)/FR-007(b)/SC-001/SC-002; witnesses `tests/wire/vlatest_reify_roundtrip_test.cpp`, `tests/codegen/vlatest_completeness_census_test.cpp`, `tests/codegen/vlatest_manifest_class_consistency_test.cpp`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-076-1 — [RESOLVED by 077-builder-args-dedup (2026-07-16)** — the component-identity `Args`-dedup redesign this entry named landed: `emit_builders.cpp` now keys each repeating group's `Args` by `(no_tag, recursive structural signature)` and emits each distinct plan **once** into `fixpp::<ns>::groups` as `G_<no_tag>Args` (one plan) or `G_<no_tag>_1..kArgs` (≥2 plans). This collapses `vlatest/Builders.hpp` from 53,590 message-rooted structs / 137 MB (>21 GB RSS, uncompilable) to **576 shared plans / ~78 MB**, compiling as a single TU at **~3.7 GiB peak RSS** (measured, T015). The vlatest typed builder tier (`build_<Msg>`/`validate_<Msg>`, gated `FIXPP_CODEGEN_FIX_LATEST`) is delivered, plus v50sp2 (558/156) and the deduped v44 (88/83); v44's wire bytes + all legacy read tiers are byte-identical (T020/T022). FR-001(b)/FR-007(a)/V-2/V-2b re-instated (V-2/V-2b generalized to the non-circular per-version completeness census, T023-T026). **v42 remains descoped — see L-077-1.** The historical descope rationale is retained below.]** The typed **builder** tier (`build_<Msg>`/`validate_<Msg>` over `wire::body_builder`, delivered for `fixpp::v44` by 067/069) is NOT generated for FIX Latest. The shared `emit_builders` emits nested-group `Args` structs **per message, non-deduplicated** (fully-qualified path names); harmless on FIX44's shallow groups (83 msgs → 1,624 structs / 3.8 MB) but combinatorially explosive on FIX Latest's depth-7 reused components (StandardHeader/Instrument/Underlying/Leg inlined across 173 app messages → **53,590 structs / 137 MB / 2.07 M-line `vlatest/Builders.hpp`**) that no consumer TU can compile (measured >21 GB RSS). `emit_builders` therefore stays v44-only (the v44 golden + additive guarantee are untouched). To construct FIX Latest messages on the wire today, use the runtime `wire::body_builder` / tag-keyed path. **Status: deferred** — the typed builder tier + a component-identity `Args`-dedup redesign (emit each shared component's `Args` once, as the read tier's version-wide `G_<no_tag>` flyweights already do) move to a follow-up feature. **The compilable target is already demonstrated by the read tier** (measured 2026-07-16): every version emits its repeating-group flyweights into a shared `fixpp::<ns>::groups` namespace with each `G_<no_tag>` emitted **exactly once** — 59 distinct on v44, 505 on v50sp2, 524 on vlatest, **no per-message re-nesting** — and the resulting `vlatest/Messages.hpp` is a single ~9.7 MB / 140 k-line header that the toolchain compiles today. An equivalent shared-`G_<no_tag>Args` builder dedup should collapse `vlatest/Builders.hpp` from 53,590 structs / 137 MB back into that same ~10 MB single-file compilable regime. *(User-decided 2026-07-16; spec.md Clarifications → Session 2026-07-16; descopes FR-001(b)/FR-007(a)/V-2/V-2b.)*

- **L-077-1 — [RESOLVED by 082-structural-group-detection (2026-08-12, PR #261) — CLOSES issue #196.** `fixpp::v42` now ships the full typed builder/validator tier — **226 generated files**, golden checked in **and** gated by a byte-diff test, wired through `cmake/Codegen.cmake` (the driver exclusion `ir.ns != "v42"` in `tools/codegen/fixpp-codegen/main.cpp` is deleted). The silent-omission hazard this row names as the reason for the descope is **closed by direct test, not by construction**: all **14** required-group omissions across the v42 message set are rejected by `writer_traits<Args>::group_checks` (`tests/codegen/test_082_v42_required_group_omission_test.cpp`, 15 tests) — so the `NewOrderList`/`NoOrders` case cited below now fails validation instead of emitting invalid FIX 4.2. 077's FR-009 objection also resolves cleanly rather than being overridden: the v42 read golden **was** regenerated (`v42_Messages.golden.hpp`, `v42_Reify.hpp`), and the other **14** read-tier artifacts were proven **bit-identical**, so the byte-identity guarantee held everywhere it still applied. vt11 remains builder-less by policy (admin-only) — that is unchanged and not a residual.] **no typed `build_<Msg>` builder for `fixpp::v42` (descoped from 077, tracked issue #196).** FIX 4.0/4.1/4.2 declare their `NumInGroup` group-count fields with the legacy XML type `INT` (not `NUMINGROUP`); the codegen emitter gates repeating-group detection on `FieldRef.type == NumInGroup`, so **v42 materializes ZERO typed repeating groups** (same root cause as **L-063-1 / L-061-1 / L-066-1**; pre-existing since 003 — the checked-in `specs/003-.../golden/v42_Messages.golden.hpp` has 0 `class G_`). FIX42.xml declares `required='Y'` groups on application messages (e.g. `NewOrderList`/`NoOrders`), so a scalar-only v42 `build_<Msg>` would **silently omit a required group → emit an invalid FIX 4.2 message** (Article VI). 077 therefore ships builders only for `{v44, v50sp2, vlatest}` and excludes v42 at the driver (`main.cpp`), like vt11. 077 cannot fix the root cause because the L-063-1 structural-group-detection fix regenerates the v42 READ golden, violating 077's FR-009 (legacy read tiers byte-identical). To construct v42 messages on the wire today, use the runtime `wire::body_builder` path. **Status: deferred** — re-instating v42 builders is blocked on the L-063-1 fix (structural group detection for FIX40/41/42), a feature-sized change with a large read-golden regen. *(User-decided 2026-07-16 at /implement — "log an issue, complete current feature"; discovered via the 077 all-version widening; tracked issue #196; cross-ref L-063-1/L-061-1/L-066-1.)*

- **B-077-1 — structural-key safety pin (077 C4).** The 077 builder dedup keys each group's `Args` by `(no_tag, recursive structural signature)` and names variants `G_<no_tag>Args` (one plan) or `G_<no_tag>_1..kArgs` (≥2 plans). A future dictionary bump that introduces a **new structural variant** of an existing `no_tag` is absorbed automatically as a **new `G_<no_tag>_<ordinal>Args`** and surfaces in the regenerated builder golden diff — never a silent mis-share into an incompatible plan. Pinned by `test_077_v42_vt11_completeness_and_c4.cpp` (bare-vs-ordinaled mutual exclusivity + ordinal-body distinctness). *(077 T026/C4; contracts/builder-completeness.md C4.)*

- **L-077-2 — Orchestra per-message tag-dedup is order-unstable (non-blocking residual, unguarded).** The `vlatest` builder's per-member required-ness is read from `MessageIR.fields[tag].ref.rule`, populated for Orchestra via `OrchestraLoaderState::expand_field_list` then tag-deduped per message by `std::ranges::sort`+`unique` (in `src/dictionary/orchestra_loader.cpp`) — **not stable**. If a single message ever declared the same tag twice with *conflicting* required-ness across occurrences, the survivor would be arbitrary. Verified empirically impossible today (an independent 181-message raw-XML census found 0 conflicting intra-message tag-reuse, 077 T004), so the builder's required-ness is correct; but the invariant is unguarded (no load/build-time assertion). *(077 T004 residual; a fail-closed guard at the dedup site is a candidate follow-up.)*

- **L-076-2 — FIX Latest `LocalMktTime`-typed fields are typed as `LocalMktDate` (074 spike-collapse, surfaced by 076's census).** `OrchestraLoader` maps the Orchestra datatype `LocalMktTime` → `field_data_type::LocalMktDate` (the "spike collapse" mapping-table entry in `src/dictionary/orchestra_loader.cpp` — there is no dedicated `LocalMktTime` enum value), so the 47 fields declared `type="LocalMktTime"` in `OrchestraFIXLatest.xml` carry a date datatype in both the runtime `Dictionary` (074) and the generated `fixpp::vlatest` read classes + census manifest (076). 076's completeness census correctly reflects this (its datatype axis excludes the six non-derivable Orchestra type names, `LocalMktTime` among them, to avoid re-deriving the emitter's mapping circularly). A time-of-day value typed as a date is a latent formatting/validation imprecision for those fields. **Status: deferred** (a 074-tier loader concern — adding a distinct `LocalMktTime` datatype is a `field_data_type`/`field_type.hpp` change, out of 076's codegen-tool scope). *(Pre-existing 074 behavior; `src/dictionary/orchestra_loader.cpp`; documented by 076 T013/T024.)*

## 078-precompiled-builder-libs (precompiled per-version builder/validator libraries, 2026-07-17)

Feature 078 is a pure **implementation-layout restructure** of the typed builder/validator tier already delivered by 077 — no new FIX coverage, no new `OFFICIAL` catalogue row, byte-identical wire output (FR-009/SC-004). It splits 077's monolithic `fixpp/<ns>/Builders.hpp` into a precompiled per-version library layout (`fixpp_builders_<ver>`/`fixpp_validators_<ver>`, always built, link-time opt-in), a slim per-message declaration header (`messages/<Msg>.hpp`), a per-plan-header shared groups region (`groups/<PlanName>.hpp` + umbrella `groups.hpp`), a validator-only shared traits header (`validators/traits.hpp`), and a per-message header-only inline mode (`FIXPP_{BUILDERS,VALIDATORS}_HEADER_ONLY[_<Msg>]`). See `docs/src/dictionary/codegen.md` § Precompiled Builder/Validator Libraries.

### Behaviors

- **B-078-1 — the pre-existing `fixpp/<ns>/Builders.hpp` include path is REMOVED; consumers migrate to `fixpp/<ns>/all.hpp` (FR-008, breaking).** This is an accepted breaking change to the include layout — the typed builder tier is opt-in and was not yet consumed in production (verified: zero `Builders.hpp` includes / zero `vX::build_`/`validate_` calls in `src/`, `include/`, `capi/`, `bindings/`, spec.md A8). `all.hpp` preserves the pre-restructuring **output behavior** (byte-identical wire, result-identical validation) but is not include-path-compatible. In default (link) mode, including `all.hpp` costs N slim declaration headers + `groups.hpp` at declaration granularity, not a monolith re-parse (R5 guard). *(FR-008; SC-005; `.specify/decisions/078-precompiled-builder-libs-verify.md` "`all.hpp` default-mode compile-cost".)*
- **B-078-2 — the 077/PR-197 heavy-builder-test CI stopgap is REMOVED (078 follow-up, branch `078-followup-ccache-t034`).** 078 makes the library's own heavy builder-test TUs link the prebuilt library instead of recompiling the monolith — measured locally: the v44 builder-completeness TU peak RSS dropped to ~0.63 GiB / 7.0 s wall (was ~3.7–4.6 GiB under the 077 monolith), and the v50sp2/vlatest completeness TUs now pull `all.hpp` default mode (~2.0 GiB) instead of the old monolith TUs — well under the 16 GB hosted-runner limit that motivated the #197 stopgap (SC-006 local evidence, T032). **The `FIXPP_BUILD_HEAVY_BUILDER_TESTS` option, its 3 preset ON overrides, and the `heavy_builder_compile` Ninja job pool are DELETED (T034); the heavy completeness/roundtrip TUs now build unconditionally** (under `FIXPP_CODEGEN_FIX_LATEST` for the vlatest cells). `/bigobj` is retained on the two address-of-everything completeness TUs as cheap insurance. The removal was gated on an explicit CI evidence run (`workflow_dispatch`) exercising the **sanitizer-instrumented legs**, including the python-bindings `asan`/`ubsan`/`tsan` matrix, which are path-gated and skip on a `pull_request` touching no `bindings/python/`/`c_api`/`.i` files (spec.md A4) — evidence runs (2026-07-18, `workflow_dispatch` on branch `078-followup-ccache-t034`, all green WITHOUT the option/pool): tier1 (incl. the python-bindings `asan`/`ubsan`/`tsan` + all C++ sanitizer + `gcc-release` legs) run 29642122251, tier2 MSVC run 29642123010, tier3 libc++ run 29642123598. *(A4/SC-006; tasks T032/T033/T034 done; `.specify/decisions/078-precompiled-builder-libs-verify.md` "US5 — heavy-test relink".)*

### Limitations

- **L-078-1 — SC-001's universal order-of-magnitude consumer-compile target is NOT achievable on `v50sp2`/`vlatest` under 077's value-semantics `Args` API.** A message's `<Msg>Args` embeds its repeating groups' `Args` **by value**, so the full transitive group-plan closure must be a *complete* type at the include site; the deduplicated group graph is densely connected (a typical large-version message's closure spans ~100–400 of ~560 plans), so no header-layout split alone can trim it below order-of-magnitude. **Measured** (per-plan-header layout, clang `-fsyntax-only`, peak RSS, vs. the ~3.6 GiB monolith baseline): **v44 — all messages ~0.21 GiB, ≥ order-of-magnitude below baseline (~17×) — MET.** **v50sp2/vlatest — median message ~0.47 GiB (~7.9×), common message (NewOrderSingle, 233-plan closure) ~0.88 GiB (~4.2×), group-densest message (TradeCaptureReport, 393-plan closure) ~1.42 GiB (~2.6×)** — each materially below the monolith and below the 1.573 GiB cost of pulling the whole per-version `groups.hpp`, but **not order-of-magnitude**. The per-plan-header split (`groups/<PlanName>.hpp`) is retained regardless because it delivers a ~2–3× typical-message reduction over pulling the full `groups.hpp` umbrella, at no correctness cost (ODR-safe, deterministic). **Status: deferred** — a forward-declared / handle-based `Args` API that would meet the universal target is a distinct, larger API change ("Option 3", out of scope for 078). *(SC-001, amended 2026-07-17; spec.md Clarifications; `.specify/decisions/078-precompiled-builder-libs-verify.md` `## compile-bench`.)*

## 080-orchestra-runtime-load (Orchestra runtime dictionary load for non-C++ consumers, 2026-07-19)

Feature 080 makes the already-runtime-loadable FIX Latest / Orchestra dictionary (delivered by 074's `dict::OrchestraLoader`) reachable from the two non-C++ acquisition surfaces that were hard-wired to `dict::XmlLoader`: the C-API `fixpp_dict_load_from_xml` and the TOML `dictionary.path` resolver. A single new dictionary-layer helper `dict::load_any(path, mr)` sniffs the document's root element (`<fix>` → `XmlLoader`, `<fixr:repository>` → `OrchestraLoader`, any other/malformed/unreadable root → fail-closed `dict::xml_parse_error`) and is called by both surfaces so the dispatch rule is defined once (FR-004). **No C-ABI change** — the only additive symbol is the public C++ `dict::load_any`; no C symbol/signature/`fixpp_error_t`/byte-frozen header changes, `FIXPP_C_ABI_VERSION` stays `1.5.0`. Spec: `specs/080-orchestra-runtime-load/`.

### Behaviors

- **B-080-1 — the C-API `fixpp_dict_load_from_xml` and the TOML `dictionary.path` resolver now accept an Orchestra `<fixr:repository>` document (behavioral contract-widening).** Before 080, feeding an `OrchestraFIXLatest.xml` to either surface failed closed — the C-API returned `FIXPP_ERR_CAPI_CONFIG_INVALID` and the TOML resolver emitted an `invalid_or_contradictory_selector` diagnostic on `dictionary.path` (both hard-wired to `XmlLoader`, which rejects the Orchestra root). Now both dispatch through `dict::load_any`: an Orchestra document loads a FIX-Latest (`session_version::vlatest`) dictionary equivalent to calling `dict::OrchestraLoader::load` directly, and a classic `<fix>` document loads byte-identically to before (FR-006). This is a **widening** of 052's shipped `fixpp_dict_load_from_xml` contract — an input that returned config-invalid now succeeds — and of the TOML resolver's; no signature, symbol, or error-code changed. *(FR-001/002/003/004/006/008/009; SC-001/002/003; witnesses `tests/dictionary/load_any_test.cpp`, `tests/capi/dictionary_load_test.cpp` `LoadOrchestraFixLatest`/`ClassicFix44LoadUnchangedPost080`, `tests/config/test_load_happy_path.cpp` `Cov_OrchestraDictPath`/`Cov_ClassicDictPathUnchangedPost080`.)*

- **B-080-2 — the frozen `include/fix/c_api/dict.h` Doxygen prose is retained verbatim for ABI stability, despite the widened behavior.** `dict.h` is byte-frozen (line 3 of `tools/capi_freeze.sha256`) and its `fixpp_dict_load_from_xml` prose still says "FIX XML data dictionary / wraps `XmlLoader`". That wording is **deliberately unchanged** — editing it would break the header byte-freeze gate for a pure documentation touch. The widened contract (the entry point accepts both `<fix>` and `<fixr:repository>` roots) is instead recorded HERE (a non-frozen operator-facing doc) and in spec.md's Contract & Compatibility Notes. Operators should treat this B&L row / the release notes — not the frozen `dict.h` comment — as the authoritative statement of accepted root elements. *(FR-005/SC-005; spec.md Frozen-header docs obligation; quickstart close-out; frozen headers verified untouched by `tools/check_capi_freeze.sh` + the `nm` symbol golden, both green without regeneration.)*

### Limitations

- **L-080-1 — a config or C-API listing BOTH a FIX50SP2 and a FIX-Latest dictionary still `std::abort`s at `version_registry` construction (074 L-074-1), retained by design as the direct-C++ fail-loud backstop.** FIX Latest shares the `v50sp2` wire app-version slot (no distinct ApplVerID until the deferred ApplExtID(1156)=303 re-keying), so a `version_registry` holding both collides and aborts (release-effective, `version_registry.cpp` ctor is noexcept). 080 does **NOT** add a config-layer collision pre-check because **no config surface can express the colliding pair**: the TOML resolver resolves a SINGLE `[dictionary]` table (one `push_back`, `size()==1`), and the C-API never populates the multi-dictionary registry — the pre-check that an earlier design draft proposed was proven dead code by a Gate-A census and descoped (FR-007 intentionally absent). The abort remains reachable only by direct C++ that hand-builds a colliding `version_registry`, where fail-loud-on-programmer-error is the intended disposition. A single FIX-Latest-only config/handle (FR-008) is fully supported. **Status: the multi-version-coexistence fix is deferred to the row-4b `version_registry` re-keying (ApplExtID(1156)=303).** *(074 L-074-1 retained; FR-007 descoped by Gate A round 1; spec.md Behaviors-and-limitations note; research.md D-3/D-4 SUPERSEDED-retained-for-audit.)*

## 081-strict-validation-residuals (strict-validation-path residual closeout, 2026-07-19)

Feature 081 resolves two tracked residuals of feature 079 (fixpp#201) on the **opt-in** runtime strict inbound-validation path (`SessionConfig::validate_inbound_messages`; default off = byte-identical no-op): Concern A (#203 / L-041-2) FIXT header/trailer acceptance, and Concern B (#205) QuickFIX per-group group-gating parity (supersedes waiver W-204-1). No new `OFFICIAL` catalogue row (correctness of existing versions only; Article VI traceability via existing rows + these B&L rows). No C-ABI change (frozen `1.5.0`; abidiff 0-diff, `nm` symbol golden byte-identical). Read/reify goldens byte-identical; only the typed-**validator** goldens (v44/v50sp2/vlatest) change (Concern B). Spec: `specs/081-strict-validation-residuals/`.

### Behaviors

- **B-081-1 — on the strict path, FIX50/FIX50SP1/FIX50SP2 application frames now ACCEPT the FIXT.1.1-owned standard header/trailer (accept-only), where they previously rejected on tag 8 (Concern A, resolves the #203 sub-part of L-041-2).** See the L-041-2 RESOLUTION note for the mechanism (validator-private FIXT framing surface merged in `as_table_view()` for the empty-`<header/>` versions) and the deliberate accept-only named-intent divergence from QuickFIX (the dictionary validator does not enforce header-field required-presence; the session FSM owns it). A malformed numeric header field is still rejected (`34=abc`/`1156=abc` → `wire_field_value_out_of_range`, exact `ref_tag`); `52=notatime` is accept-only (UtcTimestamp→String, structurally undetectable — documented). *(FR-001/002/003/003a/004/011; SC-001/003; witnesses `tests/wire/fixt_header_validate_test.cpp`, `tests/dictionary/fixt_header_merge_test.cpp`.)*

- **B-081-2 — per-group required-member enforcement is now QuickFIX group-gated on the optional-group axis (Concern B, SUPERSEDES waiver W-204-1).** 079 introduced a per-group "required-once-present" enforcement stricter than QuickFIX at 24/29,247 group contexts (all fixpp-superset — no false-accept — waived as W-204-1, tracked #205). 081 adopts QuickFIX `addXMLGroup`'s immediate-enclosing gating (a direct `required='Y'` member is enforced per group instance **iff its immediate enclosing group is itself `required='Y'`**, NOT an AND across ancestors) in both loaders + the codegen emitter + the census oracle, in lockstep. The 24 optional-group divergences collapse to **0** (non-circular raw-XML census, exact-set both directions; corroborated by a quickfix-cpp 1.16.0 per-group parity golden). A present-but-incomplete instance of an **optional** group is now accepted (matching QuickFIX); a **required** group's incomplete instance still rejects. Typed and runtime tiers agree (the typed emitter forks the group-plan identity by enclosing-usage required-ness — see the /implement blast-radius note in research.md D-5, one vlatest `NoLinesOfText` plan fork). *(FR-005/006/007/009/010; SC-002; witnesses `tests/dictionary/required_scope_{test,census_test}.cpp`, `tests/wire/required_scope_{two_tier,parity}_test.cpp`; supersedes W-204-1.)*

### Limitations

- **L-081-1 — 3 residual stricter-superset contexts remain vs real QuickFIX on an axis Concern B did not model: `MassQuote`/`NoQuoteSets`/`NoQuoteEntries(295)` (WAIVED, no false-accept).** The quickfix-cpp 1.16.0 per-group parity golden (081 T020) surfaced that fixpp requires `NoQuoteEntries(295)` as a direct required member of `NoQuoteSets(296)` in **FIX44 / FIX50 / FIX50SP1 `MassQuote('i')`**, whereas real QuickFIX does **not**: QuickFIX `addXMLGroup` (`DataDictionary.cpp:563`) hardcodes `componentRequired=false` for a `<component>` nested directly inside a `<group>`, so the required nested-group count-tag reached via the required `QuotEntryGrp` component is never marked required at the `NoQuoteSets` level. This is a **different axis** from Concern B's optional-group relaxation (here both the enclosing group and the component are `required='Y'`), which the D-3 immediate-enclosing rule never modeled. fixpp is a **bounded stricter superset** (`fixpp = QuickFIX ∪ {295}`; safe direction — fixpp would reject a `MassQuote` whose `NoQuoteSets` omits the `NoQuoteEntries` subgroup, which QuickFIX accepts; **no false-accept**), of the same lineage as the now-superseded W-204-1. FIX50SP2 is exempt (its `NoQuoteSets` is `required='N'`, so the whole subtree is optional and the quirk is masked). **Status: WAIVED (user-approved 2026-07-19)** — replicating the QuickFIX `componentRequired=false` quirk would make fixpp *less* FIX-spec-strict and re-open Gate A; kept as a named, source-verified residual instead. The parity test pins it as an exact carve-out (`kKnownSupersetContexts`, RED if the residual grows/shrinks/shifts). *(081 T020; contracts/census-and-parity.md carve-out; spec.md SC-002 amendment; verified against `reference-engines/quickfix-cpp/src/C++/DataDictionary.cpp:563`.)*

## 083-group-delimiter-resolution (per-context repeating-group delimiter, 2026-08-01)

Feature 083 replaces the dictionary's single **global, first-seen** repeating-group delimiter with a **per-context** one keyed `(msg_type, parent_path, no_tag)`, captured at LOAD time from the first field emitted into each group's field run — declaration order, which the loaders have and `message_fields()`'s tag-sorted output destroyed. Both loaders (`XmlLoader`, `OrchestraLoader`) populate it; validation, the extent walk, the typed-read splitter and the C-ABI construction path all resolve through it, so those four paths now split group instances on the same boundary. Closes **fixpp#210** and **fixpp#208**; retires L-063-3 residual (b). **`#180` was already CLOSED by 072 (2026-07-13); 083 neither closes nor reopens it** — the remaining L-063-4 cap-loop leg is tracked by **fixpp#214**. See the L-063-4 re-statement above for all three dispositions. *(Corrected 2026-08-02, Gate B r3, fixpp#216 P1 — previously read "#180 is NOT closed", which contradicted this file's own L-063-4 re-statement above, the very passage this sentence cites.)* Census over all ten dictionaries: wrong-delimiter contexts **330 → 0** (nested **235 → 0**), polluted member sets **48 → 0**. No C-ABI change (frozen `1.5.0`; `nm` exported-symbol golden byte-identical). Spec: `specs/083-group-delimiter-resolution/`.

### Behaviors

- **B-083-1 — a reused `NumInGroup` tag now resolves the delimiter its OWN message/parent path declares, not the first-seen variant's.** Previously `Dictionary::as_table_view()` populated every context's `group_first` from `group_first_field(no_tag)` — one global value per tag. The worked example: FIX44 `NoMDEntries(268)` resolves `MDEntryType(269)` in `MDFullGrp` (35=W) and `MDUpdateAction(279)` in `MDIncGrp` (35=X); before 083 both resolved `269`, so a conforming incremental-refresh message false-rejected under the strict validator. Load disposition for a declared group that resolves no delimiter is **fail-closed by default** (`dict::xml_parse_error` / `dict::orchestra_parse_error`, naming the group), with an explicit `dict::unresolved_group_policy::tolerant` opt-in that warns and skips. *(FR-001/005/006/006a/006c/010/015/023; witnesses `tests/dictionary/delimiter_census_test.cpp`, `tests/dictionary/loader_disposition_test.cpp`.)*

- **B-083-2 — the per-context member set is now exactly the declared set; the delimiter is no longer injected into it.** The old lookup made the global delimiter a member of every context so the membership probe would succeed, which added a spurious member to any context that did not otherwise declare it (48 contexts). That injection is gone and the exactness falls out of B-083-1 rather than as a second fix (FR-015). Operator-visible consequence: a message that placed the *injected* tag inside such a group was accepted before and is rejected now — enumerated as class (b) below.

- **B-083-3 — a repeating group whose delimiter is itself a NESTED group's count tag now reports ALL its declared instances on the typed-read and C-ABI top-level paths (was: one).** `OffsetTable::consume_group_extent` consumed the instance-opening delimiter with a bare increment and only descended into nested groups for members scanned *after* it, so on this shape the walk stayed inside the first nested group's instances and the extent truncated to one instance — silently. Present in **485** contexts (FIX50SP2 240 + Orchestra FIX Latest 245) and made reachable *by* B-083-1's delimiter correction. Repaired by a query-before-consume descent at the delimiter position, mirroring the existing post-delimiter descent, with the depth-cap early return mirrored too (a cap breach returns `err_group_too_large` immediately rather than burning `declared` no-op iterations). *(FR-021e / SC-016; witnesses `TypedReadSplitAgreement.ExtentWalkDescendsAtNestedGroupDelimiter_Leg{1..4}`.)*

### Release note (083) — FR-019 / FR-019a / FR-019b: the disclosed behaviour change, enumerated

This repo has no `CHANGELOG.md`; these rows are the release-note artifact (FR-019). **Three** classes change, not one. An integrator can diff their builder against the lists below rather than against prose. Classes (a) and (b) are **new rejections of construction orders that were never schema-valid** under declaration order, so **SC-007 is not violated** (C-9.7) — and this enumeration is what lets an SC-007 audit tell an intended new rejection from a regression, which it can only do for the classes it actually lists. Class (c) is a **widening** and is not an SC-007 exception.

**(a) Cause 2 — the group's GLOBAL delimiter itself moves.** Five groups: **`1677`**, **`1772`**, **`40204`**, **`41599`**, **`42060`**. A builder that opened any of these with the old global tag now fails; open with the new one. *(Pinned by W-12.)*

**(b) Cause 1 — the global value does NOT move, but a specific message/parent context's does.** Invisible to any enumeration written against the global lookup, yet accepted-today / rejected-after exactly as (a). **Measured on the shipped tree, complete — 95 contexts across 6 dictionaries** (FIX40/41/42/FIXT11: none). `old` = the pre-083 global first-seen delimiter, `new` = the delimiter that context declares. Context notation is `msgType` at message level, `msgType/parentNoTag` when nested. *(Pinned by W-11, which runs on a divergent context.)*

Two corrections to the planning-time statement of this class, recorded rather than silently absorbed: **`1677`/`1772` are affected on FIX50SP2 as well as Orchestra**, not "on Orchestra" only — they are in class (a) *and* class (b), on different axes (their global value moves, AND their per-context values differ from it). And on **Orchestra alone, `268`'s global is a THIRD value (`3106`)**, so *both* of its contexts move (W → `269`, X → `279`) where on FIX43/44/50/50SP1 only X moves.

**(c) Newly BUILDABLE (a widening, not a rejection).** Three groups `1499`, `1669`, `1919` plus six nested children `1529`, `1534`, `1540`, `1559`, `1918`, `1920` registered no delimiter at all before 083 and were rejected outright by `fixpp_group_begin`. They now construct. *(FR-019a class (c); W-11b covers the dictionary-absent arm.)*

### Interop observation (FR-020 / FR-019b) — OBSERVATIONAL ONLY

Declaration order (FR-002) is **authoritative and unconditional**. Any external reference engine whose delimiter for a given context differs is recorded as a behaviour/limitation row and **never** alters resolution. **No** compatibility mode, per-session configuration surface, or conditional branch on the inbound validation path is introduced by this feature (FR-020a) — there is exactly one resolution rule and no way to select another. The only new configuration surface anywhere in 083 is `dict::unresolved_group_policy`, which selects the **load-time disposition** for an unresolvable group (throw vs. warn-and-skip) and cannot change which delimiter a resolvable group gets.

**State of the reference engines, recorded rather than deferred:** `reference-engines/` is **absent from this working copy** (it is gitignored — see project memory `project_reference_engines_setup`), so no QuickFIX-cpp / QuickFIX-J / Fix8 cross-check was run for 083. The per-release interop gate owns that comparison; this feature contributes the rule above and the class-(b) table as the diff basis for it.

### Handoff to 082-structural-group-detection

**One line, both items, exact content.** (i) 082's **T017 / T021b** pins were narrowed to tolerate the injected delimiter in a group's member set; that injection is gone (B-083-2), so both can be flipped back to **plain equality**. (ii) 082's `implementation-notes.md` PARKED note *"5 of its 14 contexts fail"* becomes **2**. The 082-side edits are deliberately **not** scheduled as 083 tasks: 082 is parked on an unbuildable branch, so such a task could only be marked done by inspection — the false-green close-out shape. Whoever resumes 082 makes these two edits there.

## 088-firstframe-budget-timer-lifetime (bounded first-frame window — two production defects, 2026-08-07)

Feature 088 fixes the two live defects in `read_first_frame_bounded` that #232's Gate B surfaced and deliberately deferred (**fixpp#233**). It changes **no** FIX-level semantics, encoding or validation, and **introduces no OFFICIAL catalogue row** — it corrects the implementation of feature 015's FR-014/SC-011 bounded pre-session window. The governing FIX section is `[FIX-SL §4.3] Establishing a FIX connection`, already covered **Y** by S-001/S-015/S-021/S-022; 088 is recorded there for traceability, not as new coverage. Spec: `specs/088-firstframe-budget-timer-lifetime/`.

### Behaviors

- **B-088-1 — a first frame that completes exactly AT the byte budget is now admitted, not dropped.** Two independent bugs combined to reject it. The budget compared `buf.size() >= max_bytes` where 015's FR-014 says *"**exceeds**"*, and the comparison ran **before** `Framer::feed`, so a read chunk already holding a complete Logon was discarded unparsed. A valid Logon coalesced by the peer's TCP stack to exactly 4096 bytes was therefore dropped on a conforming connection. The loop now feeds the framer **first** and applies a single, strict `>` budget decision only when no frame was extractable — and the carry buffer is sized `max_bytes + 1` to match, because at capacity `max_bytes` the framer would reject the boundary byte before any parse and make the frame-vs-budget decision unreachable. The two edits are **atomic**: applying either alone leaves the boundary broken. *(FR-002/FR-007/FR-014; cells B1–B6, each mutation-proven.)*

- **B-088-2 — the first-frame deadline is armed exactly once for the whole window, not once per read.** `expires_after` sat inside the read loop, so every arriving byte restarted the clock: a peer dribbling one byte below the deadline interval could hold the accept slot open indefinitely while never exceeding the byte budget. The timer is now armed once before the loop with an absolute expiry, and the loop re-awaits that same timer. *(FR-017; cells T2a/T2b, built on test-owned intermediate timers with one-sided 5×/10× margins so they discriminate deterministically rather than by race.)*

- **B-088-3 — `Engine::stop()`'s `cancellation_type::total` now reaches a first-frame read in progress.** `co_spawn`'s initial cancellation state is terminal-only and `operator||` co-spawns each arm, so a `total` cancellation was silently swallowed by the deadline arm and an accepting session could sit in the pre-session window through shutdown. The deadline arm resets to `enable_total_cancellation()` before awaiting, and the TLS transport's `async_read_some` carries the matching OUT-mapping reset. *(FR-005/FR-006/FR-018, `[const §XI.2]`; cell T6, both legs.)*

### Limitations

- **L-088-1 — `asio_plain_transport`'s two constructors are no longer `noexcept`.** This is a **widening** (potentially-throwing is the weaker guarantee), recorded because it contradicts the ctor declarations in `specs/043-plaintext-tcp-transport/contracts/asio_plain_transport.hpp`. Cause: the timer-epoch mechanism described in L-088-2 requires a `std::make_shared<timer_epoch_state>()` default member initializer, and `make_shared` can throw `bad_alloc` — which inside a `noexcept` constructor would **terminate**, making the old declaration false rather than merely conservative. The `trap_throw` try/catch already wired at both call sites in `asio_plain_transport_factory::make` (`src/transport/transport_factory.cpp`) becomes non-vacuous and needed no change.

  **No installed surface, no ABI boundary, no C-ABI symbol moves — SC-010/SC-017 are unaffected.** `src/transport/` is not an installed include root. The type *is* named in `include/fixpp/transport/transport_factory.hpp` (a forward declaration, and a `unique_ptr` return on `make_accepted`), but both uses are of an **incomplete type**, so a constructor's `noexcept`-ness cannot reach the compiled interface. *(An earlier statement of this row claimed the type was "named in no installed header"; that was wrong and the conclusion survives on the narrower incomplete-type ground.)* The 043 contract file is **deliberately left unmodified** — it is the historical record of what 043 shipped, superseded on this one point, not falsified.

- **L-088-2 — the timer-epoch guard's suppression half has no test witness, by design.** `~asio_plain_transport`/`~asio_tls_transport` retire the armed epoch in the destructor **body**, and each timer handler captures a copy of the shared counter block (never `this`) and no-ops on a stale epoch. Cells T3/T4/T5 assert the epoch **advanced**; none asserts that a late handler was *suppressed*, so the guard's own early-return branch is uncovered. That is exactly research.md D-6.8's `guard omitted` column, published **empty on purpose** — the mutant has no killer and is discharged structurally by D-6.4. The coverage gate reached the same conclusion independently from the other direction, which is what makes it a stated residual rather than an undiscovered gap. The underlying defect it closes is real and closed: `asio::steady_timer::cancel()` cannot un-queue an **already-completed** handler, so a late cancel could otherwise land on a socket that had succeeded — and, once the transport was moved into a live `Session`, through a dangling `this`, tearing down a just-established session.

## 082-structural-group-detection (structural repeating-group detection + the `fixpp::v42` builder tier, 2026-08-12)

Closes **#196**; resolves **L-063-1**, **L-061-1**, **L-066-1**, **L-077-1** (see the resolution
brackets on each of those rows). Detection moved from the XML-declared field datatype
(`FieldRef::type == NumInGroup`) to the `<group>` element itself, at every read/validate and codegen
site. `FieldRef::type` is unchanged.

- **B-082-1 — group detection is STRUCTURAL, and the pre-082 library was ASYMMETRIC rather than uniformly group-blind.** The C-ABI outbound **write** path already decided group-ness structurally at four sites via `group_first_field(tag) != 0` (`src/capi/message_write.cpp`), so `fixpp_msg_group_begin(268)` on a FIX 4.2 dictionary **already succeeded** before this feature. 082 converges the read/validate and codegen sides onto that same predicate. This matters for expectation-setting: the chosen predicate was already in production and already correct — this is a re-point onto structural truth both loaders already tracked, not new dictionary parsing. *(spec § Context; FR-006; research D-1/D-7.)*

- **B-082-2 — the FIX 4.3 `NoRpts(82)` / `NoClearingInstructions(576)` corrections: two upstream dictionary typos, only ONE of which is a behavior change.** Both are recorded here with their evidence because the pair is the strongest available witness that the predicate is structural rather than datatype-derived, and because a reader comparing type-vs-structural counts on FIX43 will find the two sets **diverge on two tags** and reach the wrong conclusion without this note.
  - **tag 576 `NoClearingInstructions` — a REAL behavior change, `+1 tag`.** Typed `INT` in its own `<field number='576' .../>` declaration in `dictionaries/FIX43.xml`, but it **is** a `<group required='N'>` with member `ClearingInstruction`, declared in the same file. FIX44 types the same tag `NUMINGROUP` (`dictionaries/FIX44.xml`) and declares the same group. So pre-082 FIX43 was **group-blind on a real repeating group** — a live defect, not a theoretical one. FIX43's registered-group count moves **33 → 34**.
  - **tag 82 `NoRpts` — a NO-REGRESSION PIN, not a change.** Typed `NUMINGROUP` in its own `<field number='82' .../>` declaration in `dictionaries/FIX43.xml`, but it is **never** a `<group>` anywhere; it is a plain field inside `<message name='ListStatus'>` in the same file, and FIX44 types the same tag `INT` and likewise uses it plainly. The datatype gate *nominated* tag 82 as a group, but both registration stores already rejected it downstream — the bare store via `group_first_field(82) == 0`, the context-scoped store via its `members.empty()` guard. **Tag 82 was already unregistered and still is.** What changed is *why*: the rejection is now principled (the dictionary declares no `<group>`) instead of incidental (a downstream guard happened to catch it). Pinned by `RequiredScope` legs asserting `group_first_field(82) == 0`, `field_valid_for("N", 82)`, and `82 ∈ required_fields("N")` — i.e. it remains a **required plain field**, which is the leg a naïve `type OR structural` union predicate would have broken.
  - **Effective FIX43 delta: exactly one tag.** *(spec § The FIX43 divergence; US3; `contracts/predicate_census.py`.)*

- **B-082-3 (FR-006c) — the FIX 4.0/4.1/4.2 inbound parse/addressing correction ships UNCONDITIONALLY; only the added strictness is opt-in.** Two distinct halves, deliberately gated differently:
  - **Ungated:** `session.cpp` seats `inbound_tv_` in `open()` **regardless of `validate_inbound_messages`**, and 066 flipped the parser onto that table. *(Citation refreshed when fixpp#215 merged: `open()` now seats it on **both** branches — `shared_dictionary_view(cfg_.dict_snapshot)` when a snapshot is supplied, `cfg_.dictionary->as_table_view()` otherwise (both in `src/session/session.cpp`) — so the row's claim is unchanged and its original single-line citation would have been stale.)* So registering FIX40/41/42 groups changes inbound field addressing for every session on those dictionaries whether or not strict validation is enabled. This is shipped ungated because the pre-082 behavior was **documented-wrong** — group fields read as absent, or positionally wrong — and a knob defaulting to the wrong answer is not a compatibility feature.
  - **Rides the existing opt-in:** the newly-reachable group-membership checks and 079 per-group required-member enforcement are only reached when `validate_inbound_messages` is already enabled. **No second knob was added.**
  - **Operator impact:** a FIX 4.0/4.1/4.2 counterparty exchange that previously appeared to have absent group fields will now surface them correctly; code that worked around the old behavior by reading raw tags positionally should be re-checked. *(Clarifications 2026-07-29; FR-006c.)*

- **B-082-4 (FR-023) — a `<group>` element declaring ZERO members is now a LOAD ERROR in both loaders, and ZERO vendored dictionaries are affected.** Previously such a group was tolerated and silently stored with `first_field_tag = 0`, which `table_view` cannot represent — `set_group_first(t, 0)` would register member tag 0 — so the state was unreachable-but-representable and would have produced a delimiter-less group. Both `XmlLoader` and `OrchestraLoader` now reject at load, reusing the existing `xml_parse_error` / `orchestra_parse_error` classes; **no new error class and no new `fixpp::core::error` variant is added**, so the C-ABI error-enum slot pin is untouched. **Measured, not assumed: none of the ten vendored dictionaries declares a member-less `<group>`** — `contracts/predicate_census.py` emits no zero-member warning for any of them, and an independent raw-XML walk of FIX40/41/42/43 confirms it. So this is a fail-closed guard against a *future* malformed dictionary, with no effect on any shipped one. *(Open decision OD-1, user-decided 2026-07-30; FR-023.)*

**Release note (082):** Repeating-group detection is now derived from the dictionary's `<group>` element rather than the count field's declared XML datatype. **FIX 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2 gain working repeating groups** (4 / 7 / 18 groups respectively) — their group reads, group-membership validation and typed group accessors all become functional, where before they silently registered none. **FIX 4.3 gains one** (`NoClearingInstructions(576)`, an upstream `INT`-typed real group). `fixpp::v42` additionally gains the full typed builder/validator tier, so `build_MassQuote` and friends are now available for FIX 4.2 and a required repeating group can no longer be silently omitted. **FIX 4.4 / 5.0 / 5.0SP1 / 5.0SP2 / FIXT.1.1 and Orchestra FIX Latest are byte-for-byte unaffected**, pinned by golden diff rather than asserted. ⚠️ **Two interop-visible notes.** (1) The FIX 4.0/4.1/4.2 inbound parse correction is **not gated** — see B-082-3; if you previously worked around absent group fields on those versions, re-check that code. (2) A custom dictionary that declares a `<group>` with no members will now **fail to load** instead of loading into an unusable state; no vendored dictionary is affected.

## fixpp#215 — 083 `/simplify` follow-ups (2026-08-12)

Five findings surfaced by 083-group-delimiter-resolution's `/simplify` pass and deliberately left out of that PR. Four are internal cleanups with no operator-visible effect; one changes the C-ABI construction path's disposition and is recorded below. Spec: none — this is a follow-up batch, not a Spec-Kit feature. Evidence: `.specify/decisions/215-simplify-followups-verify.md`.

### Behaviors

- **B-215-1 — the C-ABI commit path now REJECTS a repeating group whose exact `(msg_type, ancestor path, no_tag)` context is not declared, instead of resolving one from the dictionary-global store.** 083 T052 already required that `fixpp_msg_commit`'s group-grammar check "must NEVER fall back to the bare global `dict->group_first_field(e.tag)`" — a fallback there "would let the builder accept an order inbound validation rejects". It enforced that by not *writing* a bare call, but the three-argument `table_view::group_first_field(msg_type, parent_path, no_tag)` it did call applies exactly that fallback **internally** on a context miss (the DUAL-STORE INVARIANT block in `include/fixpp/dict/table_view.hpp`), so the rule was stated and not enforced, and the site had no way to observe that it had happened. The commit path now resolves through `group_first_field_exact`, which reports a context miss as `std::nullopt` rather than masking it, and a miss returns `FIXPP_ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH` — joining the pre-existing `tv == nullptr` case on the same fail-closed disposition.

  **The key is the full triple, so the rejection has TWO axes, not one.** `group_ctx_equal::eq` (`include/fixpp/dict/table_view.hpp`) compares `msg_type`, `parent_path`, and `no_tag` together, so a miss fires exactly as readily when the ancestor path is wrong as when the message type is wrong:
  - **Message-type axis** — a group opened on a message type that does not declare it at all (e.g. `NoWrap(400)` opened on a `Heartbeat` that declares no group).
  - **Wrong-ancestor axis** — a group opened under the CORRECT message type but nested under a parent path the message does not declare it under (e.g. a group the message declares only at the root, opened nested one level down, or vice versa). The same `(msg_type, parent_path, no_tag)` lookup misses identically; the message-type component matching does not save it.

  **Operator-visible consequence, stated precisely.** Both axes are reachable **without a malformed dictionary**: `fixpp_msg_group_begin` and `fixpp_entry_group_begin` (both in `src/capi/message_write.cpp`) — the top-level and nested group-open entry points — both gate on the SAME bare store (`dict_->group_first_field(group_tag) == 0`), so either admits any tag that is a group *somewhere* in the dictionary, regardless of the message being built OR of where in the nesting the caller opens it, and the entry setters run no `check_dict` at all. A caller that opened a group on a message type which does not declare it, or nested a group under a parent path the message does not declare it under, previously had its instance measured against the globally-first-seen delimiter — and, where that delimiter happened to lead the instance, **committed successfully**, putting a group the message's grammar does not declare (in that message, or at that nesting location) onto the wire, which inbound validation then rejects. That is the FR-018 construction-vs-validation disagreement 083 exists to close. Such a call now returns `FIXPP_ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH` at commit, on either axis. No new error code, no C-ABI surface change (frozen `1.5.0`; `tools/check_capi_freeze.sh` PASS, 12 headers byte-identical).

  **Scope bound — the two other structural call sites are deliberately UNCHANGED.** `include/fixpp/wire/validator.hpp`'s group descent and `src/wire/offset_table.cpp`'s extent walk keep the fallback: both are bound to 041-era hand-built bare-API fixtures that populate no context store at all, so for those every context probe is a miss and exact-only resolution would break them. The new accessor is available to them; adopting it is a separate change with its own test impact. *(Witnesses: `CapiGroupDelimiterCtx.CommitFailsClosedOnAContextMissRatherThanUsingTheBareStore` for the message-type axis, `CapiGroupDelimiterCtx.CommitFailsClosedOnAWrongAncestorContextMiss` for the wrong-ancestor axis — both on the reachable C-ABI path — and `TableViewTest.GroupFirstFieldExactReportsAContextMissInsteadOfMaskingIt` for the accessor's own hit/path-miss/msg_type-miss/not-a-group distinction.)*

  **Depth ≥ 17 nesting is a further, DISTINCT wrong-ancestor-axis case (Gate B r1 O1) — ARGUED, not witnessed.** Item 3 replaced the ancestor-chain carrier this file threads with `wire::group_context::pushed()`, which **saturates** at `kMaxGroupContextDepth` (16) rather than growing unbounded. On `origin/main`, the pre-item-3 carrier was an unbounded `std::vector<uint16_t>&`, so a query at nesting depth ≥ 17 built a span of length 17+ — and `group_ctx_equal::eq`'s four-iterator `std::equal` rejects on any length mismatch against the (already-16-clamped, at insert time) stored key, so that query was a **guaranteed miss**, unconditionally, falling back to the 3-arg accessor's bare-store answer. The new 16-saturating carrier **can** match a context `as_table_view()` registered at that same depth, because both the insert-side clamp (`make_group_ctx_key`) and the new query-side saturation truncate from the same end (drop the innermost/deepest ancestor once past 16). The two are therefore NOT behaviour-identical past depth 16 — a false equivalence claim previously argued in this record and in a comment in `src/capi/message_write.cpp`, corrected by this round (see `.specify/decisions/215-simplify-followups-verify.md` for the correction and the fixer's account of why no test accompanies it).

  **This row is now WITNESSED, and its own framing was wrong in a way worth recording (fixpp#264).** The blocker is gone: `find_context_without_delim_record`’s FR-023 probe clamped the ancestor chain DURING its walk (keeping the INNERMOST 16) while `make_group_ctx_key` keeps the first 16 of the outermost-first array (the OUTERMOST 16), so past depth 16 the two built different keys and a COMPLETE dictionary was rejected at load by a message asserting an internal-invariant violation. Both sides now share one UNCLAMPED walk (`detail::group_parent_path`) and clamp only in the key builders, and a depth-17 dictionary loads and resolves (`LoaderDisposition.DeepAncestorChainLoadsAndResolvesDelimiter`, RED before that fix with exactly that message). **What this row ARGUED — a depth-≥-17 wrong-ancestor QUERY divergence — does NOT occur for a lone deep context, and that is now measured rather than argued:** `wire::group_context::pushed` saturates by DROPPING the push at 16, keeping the OUTERMOST 16, the same end `make_group_ctx_key` keeps, and every production query derives its span from a `group_context`, so store key and query key coincide past the clamp. **Where the clamp genuinely bites is a case this row did not name:** two DISTINCT contexts whose chains differ only past 16 produce byte-identical keys, and `group_ctx_key::parent_path` is a fixed 16-element array that cannot hold them apart — the per-message key-dedup kept the first record and silently DROPPED the second, so the survivor answered for both and a message nested under the dropped parent resolved the WRONG delimiter (measured: the merged context resolved the first sibling’s delimiter for both). That input is now REFUSED at load by both loaders with a diagnostic naming the collision (`LoaderDisposition.ContextsCollidingPastTheClampAreRejectedAtLoad`, RED with the check disabled). Deep-but-unambiguous dictionaries are unaffected and still load. **Residual, disclosed not fixed:** `group_ctx_query` / `group_ctx_equal` compare the caller’s span verbatim with no clamp, so a HAND-BUILT span longer than 16 — one not derived from a `group_context` — still misses a key stored clamped; no production caller can construct one.

- **B-215-2 — a `dict_snapshot` whose `source()` is not the config's `dictionary` is rejected at `open()` with `invalid_session_config`.** Item 1, Gate A (`.specify/215-dictionary-view.md`, Option C): `SessionConfig::dictionary_view` (a bare `shared_ptr<const table_view>`) is replaced by `SessionConfig::dict_snapshot`, a `shared_ptr<const fixpp::dict::dictionary_snapshot>` minted only by `fixpp::dict::make_dictionary_snapshot`. `Session::open()` now checks `cfg_.dict_snapshot->source()` against `cfg_.dictionary` before adopting the snapshot's view, closing `L-215-1` below (superseded, removed). **The identity rule is `shared_ptr` pointer equality, not value equality:** two independent loads of the same XML produce two `Dictionary` objects, and a snapshot minted from one is refused against the other. The remedy is to share the `shared_ptr`. This is deliberate and fail-closed. *(Witnesses: `SessionDictSnapshotProvenance.MismatchedSnapshotRejectedAtOpen` / `.MatchingSnapshotAcceptedAtOpen`, `.specify/215-dictionary-view.md` §6 seams 1/2.)*

### Limitations

- **L-215-2 — the strict validator still holds its own `table_view` by value, so one full copy per validating session remains.** Item 1 removes the duplicate *walks* (two on the C++ path, three on the C-ABI path, now one), but `dictionary_driven_validator` stores `fixpp::dict::table_view dict_` **by value** behind a frozen design point (`include/fixpp/wire/validator.hpp`, "SC-007: no virtual edge"), so it cannot share the session's view object. It is now copy-constructed from the view `open()` already resolved instead of re-derived from the `Dictionary` — no traversal, no per-context key reconstruction, no membership dedup rescans — but it is a copy, not a share. Removing it would mean widening the validator's storage to a `shared_ptr`, which touches a frozen decision and belongs to its own change. *(The measured claim here is the walk COUNT, pinned by `SessionTableViewReuse.*` against 083 T049's `as_table_view_call_count()` seam.)*

  **The relative cost of copy-vs-rebuild is now MEASURED, not reasoned (Gate B r1 C6).** `BM_TableView_CopyFix50SP2` / `BM_TableView_CopyFix44` (`bench/dictionary/table_view_footprint_bench.cpp`, beside the existing `BM_TableView_Build*` pair) time a bare `table_view` copy against the same two dictionaries, same methodology, `linux-clang-release`, 10 repetitions:

  | Dictionary | `BM_TableView_Build*` (walk) | `BM_TableView_Copy*` (copy) | copy / walk |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | FIX50SP2 | 212779 us mean | 17070 us mean | **8.0%** |
  | FIX44 | 2925 us mean | 679 us mean | **23.2%** |

  A copy is decisively cheaper than a second walk on both dictionaries measured (4–12x), so "1 walk + 1 copy" beats "2 walks" on the C++ `Session`, validation-ON path — the majority path this item's optimization claim rests on. The previous statement here ("reasoned, not measured") is superseded; this is the measured claim.
   **Provenance of these figures: measured BEFORE the 082 merge (`7efaa8ca`), and deliberately not re-taken.** 082 made group detection structural, which ADDS registration work to `as_table_view()` — FIX 4.2 alone goes from 0 to 18 registered groups (B-082-1). That makes the **walk** side more expensive, so the copy/walk ratio can only fall and the conclusion can only strengthen; the percentages above are therefore an upper bound on the ratio, not a current reading. Re-measuring needs a release build of `table_view_footprint_bench` on the merged tree; it was judged disproportionate for a number that is directionally safe by 5–10x of headroom. If the exact figures are ever load-bearing again, re-run `BM_TableView_Build*`/`BM_TableView_Copy*` and replace the table rather than adjusting it.

## fixpp#284 — driving a consumer-supplied executor (2026-08-21)

Issue #284 was diagnosed and fixed as a test-harness defect. The mechanism underneath it is not
test-specific: it is reachable through the public C++ API by any consumer that supplies its own
executor, which is the supported way to use `Engine`. That half is recorded here. Spec: none — this
is a consumer-contract row, not a Spec-Kit feature. Evidence: issue #284, PR #288.

### Limitations

- **L-284-1 — if you supply the executor, you own driving it to completion: if a BOUNDED run
  (e.g. `run_for`/`run_until`/`run_one_for`/`poll`/`run_one`) returns while the awaited `fixpp` operation is still
  incomplete, and no other thread continues driving that executor, a subsequent blocking wait on it
  is a PERMANENT deadlock, not a timeout.** The C++ API does not own a run loop. `EngineConfig::executor`
  is a consumer-supplied `asio::any_io_executor` (the `executor` field in `include/fixpp/core/engine_config.hpp`;
  the per-session `executor_override` in `include/fixpp/session/session_config.hpp`), and `Engine::start()`
  explicitly "**does NOT block or run the executor**" — it only `co_spawn`s the role loops
  (per its doc-comment in `include/fixpp/session/engine.hpp`). In the consumer-driven topology this row concerns — a
  manually pumped `io_context`, e.g. via a bounded run — the consumer drives it themselves; the
  session's public operations — `Session::open()`, `close()`, `send()`, `on_inbound_frame()`
  (in `include/fixpp/session/session.hpp`) — return `asio::awaitable`, so the
  natural consumer spelling is `co_spawn(ioc, …, use_future)` plus a wait. (`any_io_executor` also
  admits a self-driving `asio::thread_pool`, which has no bounded-run entry point and so cannot
  express this hazard's antecedent — this row does not apply to that shape.)

  **The deadlock.** `io_context::run_for` is `run_until`, and `run_one_until` tests
  `now < abs_time` **before** dispatching, so a window that expires returns leaving ready handlers
  **queued**. Worse, a `co_spawn`ed coroutine holds a tracked outstanding-work guard, so `run_for`
  on a context with a live session never drains early — it burns its whole window, and whether the
  awaited operation completed inside it is purely a scheduling question, not a property of the
  operation. Once `run_for` returns, nothing services the context again, so a subsequent
  `future::get()` (or any other blocking wait) parks **forever** on the same thread that was the
  only pump:

  ```cpp
  auto fut = asio::co_spawn(ioc, sess.send(payload), asio::use_future);
  ioc.run_for(200ms);   // may expire with the send still in flight — a live outcome, not a bug
  fut.get();            // parks forever: this thread was the only pump, and it is now blocked
  ```

  This is a **liveness** failure, not a latency one: there is no timeout underneath it and no error
  is ever returned. Widening the window does not fix it — it only changes how often the schedule
  loses. Nothing in `fixpp` can surface it, because from the library's side the operation is simply
  still suspended, exactly as it would be one microsecond before completing.

  **The rule.** Either (a) drive the executor to completion on a thread that is not the one waiting —
  a dedicated `ioc.run()` worker, which is precisely what the C ABI does for you — or (b) if you must
  pump on the calling thread, pump **until the operation completes**, bounded by a budget that
  *reports* rather than by a window that returns silently. A fixed window followed by an
  unconditional blocking wait is the shape to avoid. Two adjacent hazards for (b): `run_for` on an
  already-**stopped** context returns without dispatching anything (call `restart()` between
  phases, or the next pump is a silent no-op); and on the give-up path the awaited coroutine is
  still **suspended**, holding references to whatever you passed it, so destroying those objects
  before the frame is a use-after-free.

  **NOT reachable through the C ABI — prevented by construction, not merely unobserved.** The
  `fixpp_engine_*` boundary owns an internal `io_context` plus worker thread(s), each running
  `ioc_.run()` continuously with a work guard (in `fixpp_engine_start`, `src/capi/engine.cpp`), so a pure-C
  consumer never supplies or drives an executor and cannot express this shape at all. The contract
  in this row binds the C++ API only. (The blocking C-ABI calls have a *different* documented
  hazard — B-050-3's strand self-deadlock when called from inside the receive callback — which is
  unrelated to this one.)

  **Why this is documented rather than prevented.** `Engine` stores only an `any_io_executor`;
  nothing it holds can observe whether the consumer's loop is continuous or bounded, so there is no
  cheap production assertion seam — the same conclusion L-048-2 reached for the drain-overlap
  contract, and enforced the same way. A library-owned loop removes the hazard (that is what the C
  ABI's shape buys), but changing the C++ API to own one would take the executor-injection contract
  away from the consumers that depend on it.

  **Status: `wontfix` for the current executor-injection contract** — a documented consumer
  obligation, scoped to the C++ API. *(Issue #284; mechanism verified against the cached asio
  `impl/io_context.hpp` at PR #288's Gate B. Reproduced deterministically in-tree by under-serving a
  single window: the process parks — `State: S`, one thread, CPU frozen at one jiffy — and was still
  wedged at 449 s, 15x the deadline it was first killed at. Fixed test-side by
  `tests/support/pump_until_ready.hpp`, which is shape (b) above.)*

## fixpp#339 — post-close `async_connect` / `async_handshake` error mapping (2026-09-01)

Three entry guards answered a **closed** Transport with the one-shot code instead of the post-close
one, contradicting FR-006, `close()`'s own doc comment, and the two sibling guards in the same
files. Spec: none — this is a defect fix against 012-2h-transport's existing FR-006, not a new
requirement. Evidence: issue #339.

### Behaviors

- **B-339-1 — the answer to `async_connect` / `async_handshake` is decided by the ENTRY STATE, not by the call index, and every `closed` state now answers `transport_already_closed` (98) where two of them answered `transport_already_connected` (97).** The state table, which is the whole row — everything else here is why:

  ⚠️ **One table per transport, because they do not share a state set** — the TLS transport has
  `handshaken` and the plaintext one does not, and their read/write guards therefore key on
  different states. A single merged table has to claim something false about one of them.

  **TLS** — `{fresh, connected, handshaken, closed}`:

  | call | `fresh` | `connected` | `handshaken` | `closed` |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `async_connect` | attempts if idle; **97 if an attempt is IN FLIGHT** (#342). A failed attempt stays `fresh`, retryable | 97 | 97 | **98** ← moved |
  | `async_handshake` | 97 | attempts if idle; **97 if a handshake is IN FLIGHT** (#342) | 97 | **98** ← moved |
  | `async_read_some` / `async_write` | 98 | 98 | proceeds | 98 |

  **Plaintext** — `{fresh, connected, closed}`, no handshake surface:

  | call | `fresh` | `connected` | `closed` |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `async_connect` | attempts if idle; **97 if an attempt is IN FLIGHT** (#342). A failed attempt stays `fresh`, retryable | 97 | **98** ← moved |
  | `async_read_some` / `async_write` | 98 | proceeds | 98 |

  ⚠️ **THE IN-FLIGHT CASE MOVED ON 2026-09-02 — this row's original claim is now FALSE.** It read
  *"`fresh → attempts` covers the IN-FLIGHT case too … a second call issued while the first is
  still running also attempts"*. True when written; #342 then added a real in-flight guard, so an
  overlapping second call is now REFUSED with 97. The tables above carry the current answer and
  B-342-1 carries the delta. Nothing else is restated here: this row is about the `closed` column.

  FR-006 states the post-close rule without exception — *"After `close()` returns, every subsequent `async_*` returns `transport_already_closed`"* — and `async_read_some` / `async_write` already honoured it on both transports. `async_connect` and `async_handshake` did not: their one-shot guards tested `state_ != fresh` / `state_ != connected`, which `closed` also satisfies, so the closed case fell through to the one-shot answer.

  **`close()` is not the only door into `closed`, so the delta is wider than "post-`close()`".** The TLS transport also enters `closed` from inside `async_handshake` — re-derive the set with `grep -n 'state_ = state_t::closed' src/transport/asio_tls_transport.cpp` rather than trusting a count here. In that state **`async_read_some` and `async_write` already answered 98 before this change**, so the change did not invent a meaning for the failure state: it made the two remaining entry points agree with the two that were already there. The plaintext transport has no second door — `close()` is the only writer of its `closed` state.

  ⚠️ **Which handshake failures get there is a matter of WHEN, not of failing.** The returns that precede any state write leave the Transport `connected` and are genuinely retryable — the FR-017 unset/PSK rejection (the pre-handshake cancellation reap that also sat here was deleted as unreachable on 2026-09-02, #341). Everything from the OpenSSL exchange onward closes it, *including the post-exchange result-construction failure*, which is why "in-protocol" is the wrong predicate and "has the exchange been entered" is the right one. The consequence people trip on: a retry after a config rejection is a **real attempt**, not a one-shot refusal, because `connected` is the state `async_handshake` admits.

  ⚠️ **The witness gap recorded here is CLOSED BY REMOVAL, not by a measurement (#341).** This
  paragraph described a pre-handshake cancellation reap that #339 could not witness from the
  public surface. It is now deleted: `reset_cancellation_state()` re-constructs the cancellation
  state from the parent slot with `cancelled_` value-initialised, and both `this_coro` awaiters
  are `await_ready()==true`, so no suspension point separates the reset from the read and the reap
  could only ever observe `none`. It was unreachable, not merely unwitnessed — so there is no
  longer a claim here needing a witness. The FR-017 rejection remains witnessed by
  `PreflightHandshakeRejectionLeavesTransportOpen`.

  **The one-shot contract did not move for the OPEN states** — `async_connect` from `connected`/`handshaken`, `async_handshake` from `fresh`/`handshaken` — witnessed by `test_inflight_exclusivity.cpp` cells 3 and 4 (renamed 2026-09-02 to `ConnectOneShotFromSucceededState` / `HandshakeOneShotFromSucceededState`, because they are SEQUENTIAL and were mis-billed as overlap witnesses — #342). *(FR-006; FR-007 as amended; issue #339.)*

  **Three hostile-review rounds shaped this row, all on one recurring error: describing the contract by CALL COUNT when it is decided by STATE.** Cut 1 said the one-shot contract was unchanged — false for the failure state. Cut 2 said "handshake failure" without excluding the preflight returns — false for those. Cut 3 said a second call after a preflight rejection "answers 97" — false again, since `connected` is exactly the state that admits the call. The table above replaces the sentence that kept rotting, because a state table is checkable against the code and a call-count sentence is not.

  ⚠️ **What the #339 witnesses do and do not establish.** They cover the cells this change
  MOVED — the `closed` column, plus the forced-spurious-HIT arm that keeps the guard out of the
  `connected` column. They do **not** establish the whole of either table: a hostile review
  produced a one-character mutant (invert the plaintext `async_write` state guard, making
  `connected` answer 98) that leaves all five of them green. It is killed by the broader suite —
  `transport_asio_plain_transport`'s connect/read/write cell writes from `connected`, and that
  target FAILS under the mutant, measured, not assumed. So the rows above are defended, but by
  the transport suite as a whole rather than by this change's own cells; do not read the #339
  matrix as a proof of the tables.

  Witnesses, each seen RED before its green was believed: `AsioPlainTransport.PostCloseConnectReturnsAlreadyClosed`, `AsioTlsTransportErrorPaths.PostClose{Connect,Handshake}ReturnsAlreadyClosed` (one per site, each red under a mutant removing only its own guard), `PostFailedHandshakeEntryPointsReturnAlreadyClosed` (red under both TLS mutants — it probes both guards, so deliberately not part of that diagonal), and `PreflightHandshakeRejectionLeavesTransportOpen` (the forced-spurious-HIT arm: it pins the EXACT answers a still-open Transport gives — the repeated preflight rejection, and 97 from `async_connect` — and is the only cell that reds when a guard fires where it must not).

## fixpp#340 / #341 / #342 / #347 / #348 — transport contract truth, overlap guard, close() lifecycle (2026-09-02)

Three contract-vs-code divergences found by the Codex hostile review of #339's branch and
deliberately not folded into it. Two resolve on the DOCUMENT side, one is a functional delta.
Spec: none new — these are defect fixes against 012-2h-transport's existing FR-005 / FR-007.
Evidence: issues #340, #341, #342.

### Behaviors

- **B-342-1 — an OVERLAPPING `async_connect` / `async_handshake` is now REFUSED with
  `transport_already_connected` (97); before this it really attempted, and the two attempts
  corrupted each other.** This is the functional delta of the three.

  The one-shot guard is a STATE test, and `state_` advances only on SUCCESS — so for the whole
  duration of an attempt the Transport was still `fresh` (or `connected`, for handshake) and a
  second call passed straight through. That was not merely redundant: asio's composed
  `async_connect` calls `socket_.close(ec)` immediately before each endpoint attempt (vendored
  asio, `asio/impl/connect.hpp`), so the second attempt closed the socket out from under the
  first, the first could surface as `operation_aborted` — which this transport maps to
  `transport_connect_timeout` when no cancellation state is set — and the shared connect-epoch
  counter was advanced by whichever completed first.

  `connect_in_flight_` (both transports) and `handshake_in_flight_` (TLS) now carry that
  dimension. **No new error variant was minted**: 97 is what every contract site already
  published for this case, so the guard makes the published contract TRUE rather than requiring
  it to be rewritten. That was also forced — the `transport_*` family is pinned contiguous at
  94..115 (FR-034 / T006) and `error.hpp` already runs past it, so a new variant could not have
  sat in the block.

  ⚠️ **A FAILED attempt is still retryable.** The flags are cleared by an RAII guard on every
  exit path including frame destruction under cancellation, so a failed connect leaves the
  Transport `fresh` AND idle. The B-339-1 tables above carry the full state answer.

  Witnesses in `tests/transport/test_inflight_exclusivity.cpp`, each seen RED under a mutation
  that removes ONLY the mechanism it tests — the three form a diagonal, so no cell is standing in
  for another:

  | mutation | c5 TLS overlap | c6 TLS handshake overlap | c7 TLS retry | c8 plain overlap | c9 plain retry |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | delete the **TLS** connect overlap guard | **RED** | pass | pass | pass | pass |
  | delete the TLS handshake overlap guard | pass | **RED** | pass | pass | pass |
  | delete the **plaintext** connect overlap guard | pass | pass | pass | **RED** | pass |
  | guard never clears the flag (shared header) | pass | pass | **RED** | pass | **RED** |

  The last row is why the retry cells exist: a guard that sets the flag and never clears it passes
  every overlap cell while wedging the Transport into permanent 97.

  ⚠️ **The plaintext rows exist because the first version of this matrix did not have them, and
  said "delete the connect overlap guard → RED" without qualifying which one.** Cells 5 and 7 use
  `LoopbackTlsFixture`, so they mint a TLS transport and say nothing about
  `asio_plain_transport`'s independent guard — deleting THAT one left every cell green. A
  per-implementation guard needs a per-implementation witness; caught in review, closed by cells
  8-9.

  ⚠️ **Cells 5 and 6 carry a forced-spurious-HIT arm, without which they would be vacuous.** 97 is
  ALSO what the one-shot state test answers once the first call has succeeded, so "the second call
  got 97" passes with no overlap guard at all — just by letting the first finish first. Each cell
  additionally asserts the first call was still IN FLIGHT at the instant the second issued, read
  with no suspension point between it and the guard, so it cannot go stale.

- **B-342-2 — `close()` no longer sends `SSL_shutdown` underneath a suspended handshake.** A
  latent pre-existing defect, closed as a consequence of B-342-1 rather than as its own change.
  `close()` gated close-notify on `ssl_stream_ && !read_in_flight_ && !write_in_flight_`; a
  suspended `async_handshake` has `ssl_stream_` ENGAGED and neither read/write flag set, so
  `close()` reached `SSL_shutdown` with an SSL operation suspended on the stream — exactly the
  mutation that condition's own comment forbids. `handshake_in_flight_` joins the condition.

- **B-341-1 — every pre-operation cancellation reap IN THE TRANSPORT MODULE was unreachable and is
  deleted.** No behaviour changes: each deleted branch was dead. ⚠️ **The scope qualifier is load-
  bearing — the first draft of this headline said "every" with no qualifier, which is false.** The
  MECHANISM is repo-wide, but the sweep was `src/transport/` + `include/fixpp/transport/`. Reaps of
  the identical shape survive elsewhere, at least in `src/tls/file_cert_source.cpp` — whose own
  comment calls it *"load-bearing for the §6.4 binding contract"* — and `src/session/reconnect_fsm.cpp`.
  Those are other modules' contracts and are filed, not silently swept.

  Verified at the asio source rather than inferred. `awaitable_thread::reset_cancellation_state`
  re-constructs `cancellation_state` from the parent slot, and that ctor `emplace`s a fresh impl
  whose `cancelled_` is value-initialised, so emissions that already happened are NOT replayed.
  Both `this_coro` awaiters involved are `await_ready()==true` with an empty `await_suspend`, so
  no suspension point separates the reset from the read — the reap could only ever observe
  `none`.

  ⚠️ **The issue named ONE site. Do NOT trust a count here — this row first said EIGHT and was
  wrong**, because the sweep behind it covered `src/` and never `include/`, missing the shipped
  `mock_transport.hpp`. The CONDITION identifies a site, so use it instead of any number: *a reap
  is dead iff the nearest preceding `co_await` is the `reset_cancellation_state` call itself* —
  nothing between the reset and the read suspends. Re-derive with that rule over
  `src/transport/` **and** `include/fixpp/transport/`. Every reap that FOLLOWS a real `co_await`
  — post-resolve, post-connect, post-handshake, and the mock's post-`post()` reap — is reachable
  and is kept.

  ⚠️ **Consequence a caller must know, and it is the opposite of the intuitive reading.** A
  cancellation emitted BEFORE one of these calls is **DISCARDED**, not deferred: the reset
  replaces the parent slot's handler and a `cancellation_signal` retains nothing to replay into
  the new one — and co_spawn's default entry state is terminal-only, so a `total` emitted before
  entry is filtered away even before the reset drops it. Only a signal emitted while the
  operation is genuinely in flight takes effect; a caller that must not proceed must test its own
  precondition before calling, or use `close()`. (This row first claimed such a signal "takes
  effect when the first real async operation completes with `operation_aborted`" — false, and
  caught in review.) The listener already had the reachable form of the entry case — its
  `is_open()` short-circuit (RC#H) — which is why deleting its reap costs nothing.

- **B-342-3 — the in-flight flags live in `timer_epoch_state`, not on the Transport, because the
  obvious placement was a measured heap-use-after-free.** Recorded because the reasoning that
  produced the bug was written down and was persuasive.

  The flags were first plain Transport members cleared by an RAII guard holding a `bool&`, and the
  guard's header argued the hazard away: *"the surrounding coroutine body already dereferences
  `this` at every step, so a frame resumed or destroyed after the Transport died is UB with or
  without this guard."* That conflates two different things. A **resumed** frame does dereference
  `this`. A frame merely **destroyed** at a suspension point runs only its in-scope destructors —
  and `async_connect` had none that touched `this`: `resolver` and `steady_timer` hold executor
  copies. The guard's destructor was the first, so it did not inherit an existing hazard, it
  created one.

  ASan, under D-4.0 destroy-with-no-drain (Transport destroyed synchronously on the failure arm,
  its suspended frame destroyed afterwards): **heap-use-after-free, WRITE of size 1, in
  `~inflight_flag_guard`**. Not theoretical, and not found by reading — the argument above was
  written by someone who had read the code.

  The fix is the mechanism the same function already used one step over: `timer_epoch_state` is a
  separately-owned block whose whole purpose is to outlive the Transport, which is why the timer
  handlers there capture a COPY of its `shared_ptr` rather than `this`. The flags moved into it and
  the guard holds a copy, so the clear is safe whether or not the Transport still exists.

  Witnessed by `DestroyWithNoDrainDoesNotFaultInFlightGuard`, which reproduced the fault before the
  fix. ⚠️ That cell is **only meaningful under a sanitizer** — without ASan the stray one-byte write
  lands in freed-but-mapped memory and it passes regardless, so a green plain-debug run is not
  evidence for it.

- **B-347-1 — `close()` during DNS resolution no longer resurrects a closed Transport.** Both
  `async_connect` implementations tested `state_ == closed` exactly once, on entry, before
  `async_resolve`. `close()` is strand-confined and so is `async_connect`, but the RESOLVER is
  neither the socket nor reachable from `close()` — `socket_.close()` does not cancel it. A
  `close()` landing while the connect was suspended in resolution was therefore overwritten: the
  coroutine resumed, asio's composed `async_connect` OPENED the socket it needed, and
  `state_ = connected` published a live socket behind a `close()` that had already returned.
  FR-006 is unconditional and this violated it. Pre-existing on `main`; found by the Codex
  hostile review of this branch.

  Two re-tests per transport: after the resolver suspension, and again immediately before
  committing `connected` (that one also closes the socket, because asio has already opened it by
  then).

  ⚠️ **Witness accounting, stated because the obvious reading overclaims.** Cells 10 and 11 (one
  per implementation) were seen RED on the UNFIXED tree — both fail on
  `ASSERT_FALSE(connect_result->has_value())`, i.e. the connect SUCCEEDING after `close()`
  returned, which is the defect itself. But the two re-tests are **jointly** witnessed, not
  individually: deleting either one alone leaves both cells GREEN, because the other catches it.
  Measured, not assumed — each was deleted on its own and the suite re-run. The pre-commit
  re-test guards a genuinely different window (a `close()` landing after resolution, during the
  TCP connect) that is not drivable from the public surface on loopback, where that window is
  effectively instantaneous. It is defence resting on STRUCTURE, and is recorded as such rather
  than implied to be covered.

- **B-348-1 — `close()` does not perform a graceful TLS shutdown, and never did; the contract
  said otherwise in four places.** Pre-existing on `main`. The published contract read *"initiates
  best-effort bidi TLS shutdown (SSL_shutdown close-notify) bounded by `Config::tls_close_timeout`
  (1 s default); a truncated close ... surfaces as `transport_read_truncated` and is NOT treated
  as a hard error"*. Three claims, none true as shipped:

  | claim | reality |
  |---|---|
  | a close-notify is sent | the alert is generated into asio's BIO pair and never drained; `socket_.close()` immediately after discards it |
  | bounded by `tls_close_timeout` | `close()` is synchronous, returns at once, and never reads that budget on this path |
  | peer sees `transport_read_truncated` (non-fatal) | peer sees **`transport_read_error`** — an OS-level error |

  The third line is MEASURED, deterministically over repeated runs, through the public API on both
  ends — not derived from reading asio. `asio::ssl::stream` writes through a BIO pair:
  `ssl::detail::engine::shutdown()` generates the alert and `ssl::detail::io` drains it to the
  socket. Calling `SSL_shutdown()` on the native handle performs only the first half.

  ⚠️ **This row records a DEFECT, and the fix is NOT in this change.** Making it a real graceful
  shutdown requires an ASYNC `close()` — it is one of the five `noexcept` synchronous
  pure-virtuals — so "implement it" and "re-specify the abortive close as the contract" are
  different features with different blast radius. That decision is open in **#348**. What this
  change does is stop the contract asserting behaviour no implementation has (the same disposition
  #340 took) and PIN the measured behaviour with
  `test_inflight_exclusivity.cpp`'s `CloseDoesNotDeliverCloseNotify_PinsDefect348`, so a future fix
  has to come through that assertion deliberately instead of changing the wire silently.

  ⚠️ Consequence for a caller of `close()` ITSELF: the peer logs a transport read ERROR, not a
  benign truncation. ⚠️ **This is no longer the whole story for the SHIPPED teardown paths** —
  see the second amendment to this row below, which is where the current answer lives.

- **B-340-1 — `Transport::cancel()` has NO documented failure; it returns `expected_t<void>` for
  symmetry only.** Contract-side resolution: the published contract named
  `transport_already_closed` after `close()` as its ONLY documented failure, and no implementation
  ever returned it — both return `{}` unconditionally. No production caller branches on the
  result, so there was no caller evidence forcing the code side; the never-implemented failure is
  deleted from the contract instead of being added to the code. `cancel()` after `close()`
  therefore still succeeds, as it always did in fact.

  ⚠️ **The first cut of this fix changed the two HEADERS and stopped, which was not the site
  set.** The normative sources still carried both false claims and were found in review: spec
  FR-005 (`cancel()` MUST be ... thread-safe (the underlying ASIO `cancellation_signal` is
  thread-safe)`), `.specify/2h-transport.md`'s §4.1 contract comment, its `[const §X.5]`
  reentrancy row, and its §6.6 error-table row listing `cancel` among the calls answering 98 —
  plus five checklist items (CHK010/011/012/026/035) that had dispositioned those very statements
  **PASS**. All are corrected, and the checklist items are re-dispositioned SPEC-FIXED rather
  than left as passes over false text.

  The `cancellation_signal` half is #333's residue, not #340's: #333 struck it from the
  implementing header on 2026-08-31 and the contract copy plus every normative source kept
  publishing it. Both halves are wrong for the same reason — no shipped `cancel()` emits a
  `cancellation_signal` at all; each calls `socket_.cancel()`, and asio's `basic_stream_socket`
  @par Thread Safety says "Shared objects: Unsafe" without carving out `cancel`. No off-strand
  caller is claimed to exist; this corrects the contract, it does not report a live race.

## fixpp#346 / #348 / #349 — reap ordering, in-flight RAII, graceful close_async (2026-09-02)

Three follow-ons from #350. Each turned out to be a different defect than the issue that filed it
predicted, and two of the three ship with their reachability NARROWER than the issue implied — that
is the part to read. Spec: none new (defect fixes against 012-2h-transport and `[2g §6.4]`).
Evidence: issues #346, #348, #349; new issue #351.

### Behaviors

- **B-349-1 — `ReconnectFsm` no longer discards a cancellation emitted during a backoff sleep.**
  This is the branch's one live production fix.

  `wait_ec` covers only a cancellation that ABORTED the wait. A `total` emitted after the timer
  fired NATURALLY was wiped by a `reset_cancellation_state` standing above the reap — the reset
  re-constructs `cancellation_state` from the parent slot with `cancelled_` value-initialised, so an
  emission that already happened is not replayed (#341's mechanism) — and both downstream reaps then
  observed `none`. The attempt proceeded to connect with the caller's cancellation silently
  discarded. Fixed by reading the state the sleep left behind BEFORE resetting.

  ⚠️ **The loop-head reap is KEPT and must not be swept.** It is dead at attempt 0 and dead after a
  NON-ZERO backoff — exactly the two cases its old comment claimed it covered — and live only when a
  retry has a zero-length backoff, where the backoff block (which contains the reset) is skipped
  entirely. `ReconnectPolicy::delay_for_attempt` returns 0 for an empty schedule, and
  `session_config.hpp` records a shipped configuration that had one. Re-derive by walking to the
  nearest preceding SUSPENSION; `this_coro` awaiters are `await_ready()==true` and never break the
  chain.

- **B-348-1 (AMENDED) — `close_async()` exists and delivers the close-notify that `close()` throws
  away. `close()` itself is UNCHANGED.** ⚠️ This row's *"no production caller uses
  `close_async()`"* and its peer-observation paragraph were true when written and are
  **SUPERSEDED** by the second amendment below; read that one for what ships. Nothing else in this
  row has changed.

  What is new is an opt-in entry point. `Transport::close_async()` is a virtual WITH A DEFAULT
  (`co_return close();`), so the `[const §XIV.2]` five-**pure**-virtual cap is untouched and no
  implementor changes. The TLS override drives `ssl_stream_->async_shutdown`, which is what actually
  writes the alert to the next layer, bounded by `Config::tls_close_timeout` — the first path on
  which that documented budget has any role.

  Measured at the PEER: a peer whose read is pending sees `transport_read_eof` after
  `close_async()` where `close()` gives `transport_read_error`.

  ⚠️ **#348 IS NOT CLOSED BY THIS.** Shipping the capability and adopting it are separate decisions.
  The obstacle is named at the declaration: `Session`'s terminal close emits
  `cancellation_type::total` immediately before closing, which would cancel an awaited shutdown.

- **B-348-1 (AMENDED 2) — the shipped teardown paths now use `close_async()`, so a peer of a fixpp
  session that closes cleanly observes `transport_read_eof`. `close()` is still unchanged and a
  direct caller of it still gets the abortive close.**

  Two adoptions, both measured at the PEER:

  | teardown path | peer read outcome |
  |---|---|
  | `Engine::stop()` — the per-session transport close on each session strand | `transport_read_eof` |
  | `Session::close(terminal)` — the close that follows the root total-cancel | `transport_read_eof` |
  | a direct `Transport::close()` call | `transport_read_error` — unchanged, and still pinned |

  ⚠️ **THE STATED OBSTACLE WAS NOT THE REAL ONE.** The first amendment named the blocker as
  `Session`'s terminal close emitting `cancellation_type::total` before closing, which "would cancel
  an awaited shutdown". It would not: `Session::close()` disables cancellation on its own frame as
  its first statement, so that emission never reached the awaited close. The real blocker was in the
  transport, not at the call site: at both sites an SSL operation is suspended — the read pump
  is blocked in `async_read_some`, and the root total-cancel that precedes the close has not yet
  been delivered to it — and `close_async()` inherited `close()`'s rule of skipping the alert
  whenever that is so. Adopting it unchanged would have compiled, passed, and delivered nothing.

  `close_async()` now QUIESCES instead of skipping: `socket_.cancel()` completes the pending
  operation with `operation_aborted` without touching SSL state, the coroutine unwinds, the
  `inflight_flag_guard` clears the flag, and only then is the alert written. `state_` is closed
  before the cancel, so a woken pump cannot start a new read and the join terminates. The whole
  call — quiesce plus shutdown — is bounded by ONE `Config::tls_close_timeout` budget, and an
  operation that does not quiesce inside it falls back to the abortive close. **The worst case is
  therefore the old behaviour plus a bounded wait, never a hang.**

  ⚠️ **`close(graceful)` is NOT in that table, deliberately.** It reaches the same adopted site, but
  only after phase 1; on the phase-1 TIMEOUT arm `session.cpp`'s FQ-G force-close has already closed
  the transport abortively, and the `close_async` below it is then the idempotent no-op — so the
  peer's outcome on that arm is `transport_read_error`, unchanged. The row claims only what the
  witnesses drive.

  ⚠️ **KNOWN, BOUNDED, AND NOT FIXED: a close arriving DURING an in-flight `close_async()` is told
  `{}` before the socket is actually closed.** `close_async()` publishes `state_ = closed` before it
  suspends, so both `close()` and a second `close_async()` become no-ops for up to
  `tls_close_timeout` while the first call finishes. That is subsumption rather than a leak *only*
  because every exit from `close_async()` past that transition closes the socket, including the
  exceptional one — the `catch(...)` is what makes the second caller's `{}` honest. Making `close()`
  fall through instead was considered and rejected: it buys a difference observable only against a
  WEDGED operation, which nothing in the suite can produce, so it would ship an unwitnessable branch.
  Revisit if an adopter appears that races the two entry points and acts on the early `{}`.

  ⚠️ **Sites deliberately NOT adopted**, so the next reader does not read the two above as "all of
  them": the accept-loop reject paths in `engine.cpp` (bad dynamic_cast, handshake failure,
  first-frame failure, malformed CompIDs, registry mismatch, `open()` failure) and `session.cpp`'s
  FQ-G force-close of a wedged logout phase 1. The reject paths are serial in the accept loop, so a
  graceful close there lets one unresponsive peer per connection spend the close budget ahead of
  every other pending accept; the FQ-G close exists to unwedge a blocked writer, where abortive is
  the intent. Derive the current adopters with `git grep close_async -- src`, never from this list.

  Witnesses: `tests/session/engine_readpump_test.cpp`'s
  `EngineStopDeliversCloseNotifyToPeer_Fixes348` and
  `SessionTerminalCloseDeliversCloseNotifyToPeer_Fixes348` assert the PEER's read outcome, and each
  was proven RED against a tree with ONLY its own adoption reverted. The transport-level quiesce is
  witnessed by `CloseAsyncQuiescesOwnPendingReadAndStillDeliversAlert_Fixes348`, proven RED by
  restoring the `|| ssl_op_suspended_()` bail — a mutation under which the pre-existing
  `CloseAsyncDeliversCloseNotify_Fixes348` stays GREEN, which is why that cell alone was not
  evidence for any of this.

### Limitations

- **L-349-1 — `[2g §6.4]`'s pre-I/O reap does not fire for any caller in this repo, and correcting
  its ORDER was necessary but not sufficient.** **Status: wontfix — #351 closed on the measurement
  in B-351-1 above, and this row is now the standing record.** Opting the caller out of
  `throw_if_cancelled` is ALSO not sufficient: the in-tree caller's own pre-load reap answers first
  and `load_credentials()` is never entered, so the §6.4 window is empty from this repo in both
  directions. Delivering §6.4 needs a caller with a genuinely non-empty window; the recipe in
  `include/fixpp/tls/cert_source.hpp` states that precondition for third-party implementors.

  asio's `await_transform` for a child awaitable throws `operation_aborted` when
  `throw_if_cancelled_` — which DEFAULTS TO TRUE and is per-`awaitable_thread` — sees the inherited
  state already cancelled. That is the same predicate the reap tests, checked first, so the throw
  wins and the child body never runs. A caller gets a thrown error, not the `tls_load_cancelled`
  §6.4 names.

  ⚠️ This row previously offered `git grep throw_if_cancelled -- src include` as the re-derivation
  and asserted it was empty. That command matches the explanatory comments in `transport.hpp`,
  `cert_source.hpp` and `reconnect_fsm.cpp` and so returns hits regardless — a recipe that reports
  the opposite of the claim. The claim it was standing in for is a CONDITION, not a count: no caller
  in this repo turns asio's `throw_if_cancelled` OFF around a `load_credentials()` call, and each of
  the three production callers is non-firing for its own reason. Re-derive by reading those three
  sites, not by grepping for the identifier. All three production callers of
  `load_credentials()` are non-firing: `reconnect_fsm` awaits it with the default, and the two
  ctor-time sites use `co_spawn(..., asio::detached)`, which binds no cancellation slot at all so
  `cancelled()` is permanently `none`. The `file_cert_source` reap is therefore CORRECT AND INERT.

  Operator impact: none today — no shipped path depends on that error value. Implementor impact:
  `include/fixpp/tls/cert_source.hpp` publishes the §6.4 recipe for third-party `cert_source`
  authors, and a correctly-ordered step 3 copied from it can still never fire unless that author
  also controls the caller. Both that header and `transport.hpp`'s CANCELLATION TIMING note now
  state the precondition.

- **L-346-1 — read/write in-flight flags are RAII-guarded, and the wedge they prevent has NO
  behavioural witness. The claim rests on STRUCTURE, the way B-339-1 does.**

  `read_in_flight` / `write_in_flight` moved into `timer_epoch_state` and are set and cleared by
  `inflight_flag_guard`, so the clear runs on frame destruction as well as on every `co_return`.
  Binding such a guard to a Transport MEMBER is a measured heap-use-after-free, which is why the
  flags live in the block that outlives the Transport.

  ⚠️ **A wedge requires a frame destroyed mid-body AND a Transport that survives to exhibit the
  stuck flag, and no caller-reachable path produces both.** Cancellation — total or terminal —
  RESUMES the frame with `operation_aborted`, on which a plain assignment below the `co_await` runs
  perfectly well; a frame is destroyed mid-body only when its handler chain is destroyed unrun
  (`~awaitable_thread`, i.e. io_context teardown), which takes the Transport's executor with it.

  Two witness shapes were built and both MEASURED unsound — one passed on the unconverted tree
  (vacuous), the other failed on the converted one because the frame was neither destroyed nor
  resumed, i.e. it measured "still in flight" rather than "wedged". ⚠️ Do not discharge this row
  with a cell that goes green; show it RED first against a tree with the guards reverted to plain
  assignment, which is the step that killed both attempts.

## fixpp#353 / #354 / #357 / #358 — transport cancellation reach, sanitizer carve-out, closure audit (2026-09-03)

### Behaviors

- **B-357-1 — A `Transport` implementor's coroutine does not deliver `Engine::stop()`'s
  `cancellation_type::total` to the operation it awaits unless it MAPS that signal down, and which
  ops need the mapping is decided by what is awaited, not by read-vs-write.** `Engine::stop()` emits
  `total`. asio's SSL `ssl::detail::io_op` derives from `base_from_cancellation_state`'s no-filter
  constructor, which builds a **terminal-only** state; asio's composed `async_write` installs
  `enable_partial_cancellation()` — a `terminal|partial` mask that also excludes `total`. A
  one-argument `reset_cancellation_state(enable_total_cancellation())` installs that filter as
  **both** the in and the out filter, so `total` is accepted by the outer frame and then silently
  dropped one or two layers down: the awaited op never aborts. The two-argument form, whose OUT
  filter maps any accepted signal to `terminal`, is what reaches it. A coroutine awaiting a **raw**
  reactive socket op (`socket_.async_read_some`) needs none of this — that op's cancellation handler
  accepts `terminal|partial|total` directly.

  ⚠️ **Re-derive the classification from the awaited call, never from a list of methods.** The
  discriminator is COMPOSED-or-SSL versus RAW; a list of "the sites that need it" is a result and
  rots the moment an op changes what it awaits. The canonical note lives at
  `include/fixpp/transport/transport.hpp` with the re-derivation recipe. *(#357; PR #362.)*

- **B-358-1 — A cancellation state installed by a CALLER does not survive a callee that resets its
  own.** `co_await this_coro::reset_cancellation_state(...)` does not layer a scope onto the
  caller's state; it **replaces the bottom-frame state for the whole `co_spawn` chain**. So a caller
  that shields itself with `asio::disable_cancellation{}` is unshielded the instant it awaits a
  callee that resets — which is exactly how `Session::close()` came to hang once #356 adopted
  `close_async()` (measured 11 of 40 runs wedged; 0 of 40 after). Verify at every callee that
  suspends inside the shield, not at the call site. *(#358; PR #362.)*

## fixpp#389 — repeating-group slices are per-group, and the reserve estimator is gone (2026-09-07)

### Behaviours

- **B-389-1 — each `no_tag`'s slices live in their OWN exact-sized array; a span returned by
  `group_slices()` is now stable for the whole table lifetime.** Previously every group's slices
  shared one growable `group_slices_` vector, reserved once to an estimate
  (`group_slices_reserve_bound()`). **The estimate could be exceeded**, and when it was, the shared
  vector reallocated and every span already handed out for an EARLIER `no_tag` dangled —
  `src/capi/message_read.cpp` stores exactly such a span in `fixpp_group::slices` and holds it
  across C-ABI calls.
  **The mechanism was two delimiters and one cap.** `consume_group_extent()` walks with the WIRE
  delimiter and caps at the DECLARED count, producing `group_end`; `group_slices_status()` then
  re-splits that extent with the DICTIONARY delimiter under no cap at all. The estimator summed
  declared counts and bridged the two with *"each contributes ≥ its actual pushes
  (consume_group_extent caps instances at `declared`)"* — an inference from the capped loop to the
  uncapped one. Live on the shipped path since 083: `OutOfScopeWireProbesUnchanged` pushes 3 slices
  for a `100=2` group against a bound of 2.
  ⭐ **Why the estimator was DELETED rather than corrected.** The hazard was never "the bound is
  wrong" — it was that N groups shared ONE growable array, so an estimator and a split loop in two
  places had to agree **forever**. 083 changed the loop and left the estimator, and nothing detected
  it for two features. A better bound restates that obligation; per-group storage removes it. There
  is nothing left to estimate.
  **Arena cost went DOWN where the old bound was SOUND, which is what keeps PR #181 closed.**
  Allocation is now exactly the slice count — strictly less than the old reservation whenever
  `declared` exceeded the actual count (the hostile `453=999`-with-one-instance frame reserved 8
  slices and now allocates 1). ⚠️ **It is NOT ≤ the old reservation for every input, and the
  exception is this defect itself:** where the bound was too small, allocating exactly is
  necessarily allocating MORE than it. This PR's own witness is such an input — old estimator
  `2 + 2 = 4`, actual pushes `5`. The old shape "fit" only by silently reallocating, which is the
  stale span. Exactness trades a bounded increase on unsound-bound inputs for the removal of the
  hazard; #181's constraint is about the ~3x systematic over-allocation, not about these bytes.
  ⚠️ **That exactness depends on the COUNT PASS**, which is load-bearing rather than an
  optimisation: pushing into an unreserved vector backed by the fixed null-upstream monotonic arena
  strands every superseded buffer (1+2+4+…, never reused), which for a 75-instance group
  (`ArenaFit.NearCapHeadroomProbe`) is 255×16 = 4080 B against 1200 B exact — that would re-open
  #181. ⚠️ **That figure is libstdc++'s (2× growth). MSVC release — the platform #181 is actually
  about — grows 1.5×, so the number there is different and was NOT measured.** The source comments
  deliberately carry the mechanism and point here rather than repeating a platform-specific result. The count pass and the fill loop share ONE
  `is_boundary` lambda. That is the point rather than a tidiness: two spellings of the boundary is
  the same two-places-must-agree obligation the deleted estimator carried, one scope smaller.
  **No API change** — `group_slices()` still returns `std::span<group_slice const>`; the C-ABI and
  `MessageView::group<>()` are untouched. The span is now safe **by construction** against the
  reallocation hazard rather than by the caller's allocator choice.
  ⚠️ **The index row is a raw `(ptr, count)`, and a `static_assert` pins it at ≤ 16 B on purpose — the first shape was a
  `std::pmr::vector` member and it was measured WRONG.** That took the row from 12 B to 40 B: a
  `std::pmr::vector` member costs three pointers **plus** a `memory_resource*` duplicating the
  table's own — 32 B of metadata measured on this toolchain — to hold what a raw `(ptr, count)`
  holds in 12. It
  matters more than it looks: `group_index_` gains a row per **distinct `no_tag` QUERIED** — the
  negative result is memoised too, so a tag that DECLINES still mints one — and the C-ABI's
  `fixpp_msg_get_group` takes a **caller-supplied** tag, so the row count is driven by caller
  behaviour rather than by message content. How many distinct tags exhaust the 16 KiB arena is a
  RESULT — it depends on the STL's vector growth factor and on what `entries_` has already taken —
  and three different figures for it were written here and did not reconcile, so none is kept. What
  does not rot is the ORDERING, which follows from row size alone: the shipped 16 B row admits fewer
  distinct tags than the old 12 B one, and far more than the 40 B first attempt. To re-derive the
  numbers, query ascending distinct `no_tag`s against a 16 KiB null-upstream arena with
  `tests/support/pmr_allocation_tracking_resource.hpp` and record the platform. ⚠️ **The shipped row
  does NOT restore the old headroom and this row does not claim it does.** That is the honest price of holding a `(ptr, count)` instead of two
  `uint32` indices into a shared vector, and it is worth paying; tripling it was not.
  Raw storage also makes `group_span` trivially copyable, so index reallocation is a memcpy and the
  move-vs-copy question disappears entirely — a `static_assert` pins both properties, because the
  next person to add a field to that row will not have read this paragraph.
  ⚠️ **Copying an `OffsetTable` is now DELETED, and that is a consequence of this change rather
  than tidying.** The rows hold raw pointers into *this* table's arena, so an implicit copy would
  alias the SOURCE's arena and dangle when it dies — a lifetime coupling the old `std::pmr::vector`
  member did not create, since it carried its own buffer. No caller copies one (`fixpp_msg_clone`
  rebuilds over its own frame), and **deleting the copy is what measures that** instead of
  asserting it: a future copy site is a compile error, not a silent dangling read. Move stays,
  explicitly defaulted because declaring the copy operations would otherwise suppress it.
  *(#389; witness `tests/wire/typed_read_split_agreement_test.cpp`
  `MaterializingADivergentGroupDoesNotMoveAnotherGroupsSlices` — **mutation-proven: RED against the
  pre-#389 tree, GREEN after**. ⚠️ The witness asserts POINTER IDENTITY of the re-fetched cached
  span, not slice contents: reading through a moved span is UB that on the shipped path returns
  **correct bytes**, because a `monotonic_buffer_resource` never reuses the abandoned block. A
  contents assertion is green under both shapes — which is exactly why this survived since 083.
  ⚠️ **Pointer identity alone is NOT sufficient**, and that is measured rather than reasoned: it
  discriminates only the shape that shipped, whose cache-hit path recomputed the span from the
  current base. A shared-vector variant storing the already-RESOLVED pointer compares EQUAL after a
  reallocation, into freed memory. The companion witness
  `ArenaConsumptionIsIndependentOfGroupMaterializationOrder` closes that gap by asserting a property
  no shared growable buffer can have — arena consumption independent of materialization order. Under
  an emulated shared buffer the pointer cell stayed **GREEN** and the order cell went **RED**
  (160 B vs 176 B).)*

### Amended by this issue

- **083 C-8.0a is discharged by construction, and its unscoped verdict is retracted.** C-8.0a was an
  *assessment obligation* (FR-021c: the effect of 083's changed member sets on the estimator "MUST be
  assessed and recorded"), not a design invariant — nothing in it required the estimator to have
  member-set-only inputs, or to exist. Its recorded verdict read *"the under-reserve failure mode is
  impossible by construction, not merely unlikely."* **That sentence is false and #389 is its
  counter-example.** ⚠️ Narrowly: Leg 1's own body is SCOPED — *"unreachable through a member-set
  change"* — and stays true, because the estimator's predicate really is byte-identical to the push
  gate. What it establishes is WHICH groups push, never HOW MANY per group; the unscoped verdict
  above it generalised past its own argument. The retraction narrows that sentence rather than
  condemning the leg.
- **W-10's "UNCHANGED probe 3" is retired**, not deleted quietly. It asserted the reserve bound was
  equal on the pre-083 and post-083 tables. ⚠️ **The probe was TRUE and the property it certified was
  not:** the estimator really did consume member sets alone, which is precisely why it could not see
  that 083 had changed the split loop's delimiter underneath it. Equal reservations was a fact about
  inputs, read as evidence the reservation was *adequate*. Replaced by the positive witness above.
- **`HostileInputHardening.InflatedGroupCountClampedToEntryCountInReserveBound`** → renamed
  `InflatedGroupCountDoesNotInflateArenaUse` and retargeted from the estimator's return value to the
  **bytes the arena actually hands out** (`pmr_allocation_tracking_resource`). The old cell could not
  have caught a split loop that allocated for 999 while the bound clamped to 8; the new one can.

## fixpp#360 / #361 — close_async's recovery witness, and a resolve a deadline can end (2026-09-06)

### Behaviors

- **B-361-1 — `Transport::Config::connect_timeout` now bounds `async_connect` AS A WHOLE, name
  resolution included, and `Engine::stop()`'s `total` reaches a connect suspended in resolution.**
  Both transports compute ONE absolute deadline (`now() + connect_timeout`) before resolving and
  reuse it for the connect timer, so the budget is not spent once per phase. The resolve itself is
  issued through `src/transport/bounded_resolve.hpp`, which waits on a gate timer rather than on the
  resolve — asio's `resolve_query_op` takes no cancellation slot, so the op cannot be aborted and is
  instead ABANDONED, its completion handler owning the resolver and the result storage. Callers see
  `transport_connect_timeout` when the deadline wins and `transport_connect_cancelled` when the
  cancellation does; both leave the transport `fresh` and retryable. ⚠️ The cancelled case CHANGES
  C-API CATEGORY for a caller that was previously seeing a resolve failure: 94
  `FIXPP_ERR_TRANSPORT_LIFECYCLE` becomes 111 `FIXPP_ERR_CANCELLED`. The timeout case does not
  (94 and 96 share `FIXPP_ERR_TRANSPORT_LIFECYCLE`), and the reconnect FSM branches only on
  success/failure, so retry policy is unaffected either way.

  ⚠️ **A `connect_timeout` shorter than the host's name-service bound now fails EVERY attempt in
  resolution** — which is the honest report, but it is a new way to configure a session into never
  connecting. See L-361-2 for what those abandoned lookups then do to each other. Measured against a blackholed
  nameserver with `connect_timeout = 2 s`: `async_connect` retires at 2,000 ms (was 20,030 ms), and
  at ~302 ms under a `total` emitted at 300 ms (was 20,030 ms); control arm on a working resolver,
  43-87 ms — that row varies with the network and is the one figure here not to read as a constant.
  Re-derive with `tools/probes/resolve_bound_probe.cpp`; its control arm is not optional. *(#361; supersedes L-361-1, which is
  in the closed archive.)*

- **B-360-1 — `close_async()`'s `catch (...)` recovery path has a witness again, through a fault
  seam rather than a cancellation.** `asio_tls_transport::set_close_fault_hook()` (internal header;
  `src/` is not an installed include root) INJECTS an exception at the `async_shutdown` co_await —
  the same point #348's cancellation used to throw at, chosen so the handler is re-entered with the
  close deadline ARMED and its epoch un-retired, not merely with the socket open. It is reached
  through the class's already-unconditional `asio_tls_transport_test_access` friend rather than
  through a setter, so nothing inside the class definition differs between the test TU and the
  library. Witness: `InflightExclusivity.CloseAsyncFaultAfterQuiesceStillClosesTheSocket`; RED arm,
  unchanged from #348's: delete the `socket_.close(ec)` from the handler. ⚠️ It pins ONE entry
  state; a throw earlier in the `try` (the quiesce loop) is still unwitnessed, and injecting at that
  boundary is not evidence about asio's own allocation failing there. *(#360.)*

### Limitations

- **L-361-2 — Bounding the resolve bounds the OPERATION, not DRAINING the io_context: an abandoned
  `getaddrinfo` still holds asio work, so `io_context::run()` does not return and `~io_context`
  blocks until the host's name-service stack gives up.** `resolver_thread_pool::start_resolve_op`
  calls `scheduler_.work_started()`, and `resolver_thread_pool::shutdown()` **joins** its work
  threads — both unconditional in asio 1.38 and independent of the IOCP/reactor split, so this is
  not a Linux-only property. Measured against a blackholed nameserver, abandoning at 300 ms:
  `io_context::run()` returned at 20,019-20,039 ms across runs, and `~io_context` took 19,715 ms in
  a variant that destroys the context instead — against a sub-100 ms control on a working resolver. **Status: by design / wontfix at this cost.** The only construction
  that would bound it is leaving asio's resolver for a thread fixpp detaches, which trades a bounded
  teardown for a detached thread per attempt and an exit-time hazard; not taken.

  ⚠️ **How long that is remains a property of the HOST, not of fixpp**, and depends on which NSS
  backend resolves `hosts:`. `getaddrinfo` is dispatched through `/etc/nsswitch.conf`. **For the
  `dns` backend** the bound is glibc's `timeout` (default 5 s) x `attempts` (default 2) x each
  `nameserver` x the A/AAAA pair. Measured 2026-09-06 against that backend (`hosts: files
  mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns`), with a bind-mounted `/etc/resolv.conf` in a private mount
  namespace:

  | `/etc/resolv.conf` | elapsed |
  |---|---|
  | working resolver — control | 62 ms |
  | 1 blackholed nameserver, glibc defaults | 20.0 s |
  | 3 blackholed nameservers, glibc defaults | 56.0 s |
  | 1 blackholed nameserver, `options timeout:1 attempts:1` | 2.0 s |

  ⚠️ **DO NOT READ THAT AS "BOUNDED" IN GENERAL.** It is measured for the `dns` backend only.
  `nsswitch.conf` may route `hosts:` to `sss`, `ldap`, `mdns`, `resolve` (systemd-resolved) or a
  vendor module, and those impose their own deadline or none — `resolv.conf` does not govern them.
  The honest statement is that **draining the io_context inherits whatever bound the host's
  name-service stack has, including none**; the DNS numbers are the one case measured, and they are
  what makes the deployment-side lever worth naming, not a guarantee.

  ⚠️ **THE SHARPER HALF IS SERIALISATION, NOT DRAIN TIME.** asio's resolver pool defaults to ONE
  work thread (`config(context).get("resolver", "threads", 0U)`, then `num_work_threads_ = 1`) and
  is an `execution_context_service_base` — one pool per `io_context`, shared by every session on it,
  draining blocking lookups SERIALLY. Before #361 a wedged `getaddrinfo` blocked its own caller, so
  at most one lookup was outstanding per transport and the next reconnect attempt could not start
  until the previous returned. Now the attempt retires at its deadline while the lookup keeps
  running, so **retries stack behind it, and so does every other session's resolve on that
  `io_context` — including for hosts that would answer instantly.**

  fixpp bounds the stacking rather than the lookup: `bounded_resolve.hpp`'s
  `kMaxAbandonedResolves` (4) makes `resolve_bounded` REFUSE with `transport_resolve_failed` once
  that many abandoned lookups are still outstanding, instead of adding one more. That turns the
  drain from unbounded into "at most 4 x the host's name-service bound", and a lookup queued behind
  four wedged ones could not have completed inside any caller's budget anyway. The count is
  process-wide while the pool is per-`io_context`, so it is conservative — it can refuse earlier
  than strictly necessary, never later. ⚠️ **The lever that actually helps is not fixpp's**: asio's
  `resolver`/`threads` config key is set at the application's `io_context` construction.

  ⚠️ **THAT "COULD NOT HAVE COMPLETED ANYWAY" IS CONDITIONAL ON THE ONE POOL THREAD, AND THE
  APPLICATION CAN REMOVE THE CONDITION.** It holds because a fifth lookup cannot even START until
  the four outstanding ones return — which, by definition of outstanding, they have not. Raise
  asio's `resolver`/`threads` above 1 and the lookups drain in PARALLEL, at which point a refused
  fifth resolve might have answered promptly and `kMaxAbandonedResolves` becomes a real
  false-refusal: `transport_resolve_failed` for a host that is fine. The same shape is reachable at
  `threads = 1` without a wedge at all — a SLOW-BUT-WORKING resolver plus a `connect_timeout`
  shorter than it — except there the refusal is the honest answer rather than a false one, because
  the serial queue really does put the fifth lookup past the budget. **A deployment that raises
  `threads` should raise `kMaxAbandonedResolves` with it**; the constant is a compile-time
  `inline constexpr` in `bounded_resolve.hpp`, not configuration, because no caller has asked for
  the knob and the coupling is to a value fixpp cannot read back from asio.

  ⚠️ **`resolver.cancel()` is still not a fix for this half either.** asio's
  `background_getaddrinfo` tests its cancellation token **once, before** the blocking call, so
  `resolver.cancel()` only wins the window before the lookup starts; an in-flight `getaddrinfo` runs
  to completion regardless. That is exactly why #361's fix abandons the op instead of cancelling it.
  *(#361; the residual left by B-361-1.)*

## fixpp#220 — `OffsetTable::group()` is a dictionary-only operation (2026-09-06)

### Behaviors

- **B-220-1 — a dict-free `OffsetTable` reports every repeating group ABSENT; it no longer derives a
  group extent from the wire.** Construction without a group-membership predicate —
  `OffsetTable(frame, mr)`, `OffsetTable(frame, mr, Config)`, any construction passing a null
  `group_member_fn`, and `Parser<access_mode::Index>{}` (the **public default constructor**, which
  threads no dictionary) — makes `group(no_tag)` return `wire_required_field_missing` for **every**
  `no_tag`, including one that is a real group count field on the wire. Consequently
  `group_slices(no_tag)` yields an **empty span**, and the C-ABI thunk reports
  `FIXPP_ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH` — the documented E-2 / CA-010-read result, the same answer the
  dict-aware path gives for a tag the dictionary does not know to be a group. **What else changes, stated
  rather than waved past:** scalar reads, `find()`, `entries()`, `unknown_fields()` and the whole
  Iter-mode surface are unaffected, and the dictionary-backed path (`Parser{dict}` — every production
  caller) is byte-for-byte unchanged in behaviour. **One further dict-free change is NOT nothing:**
  `group_slices_reserve_bound()` returned `0` for a dict-free table instead of `entries_.size()`
  *(⚠️ the function itself was **deleted** by #389 — see B-389-1; the arena consequence below still
  holds, now by construction rather than by a bound: a dict-free table appends no slice, so it
  allocates none)*,
  because such a table can no longer append a slice. That lowers arena consumption (the old bound
  reserved up to `4096 * sizeof(group_slice)` for slices that cannot exist) and, as a consequence,
  makes the dict-free `alloc_failed` degrade in `group_slices_status()` unreachable — there is no
  longer an allocation on that path to fail. The `bad_alloc` degrade is still covered, on the
  dict-aware path, by `OffsetTableErrorPath.GroupSlicesBadAllocDegradeCoversLines231to232`.
  **Why this is the conformant answer rather than a capability regression:** `[2b §4.7]` defines a
  repeating group's boundary as the dictionary's first-field-of-group rule per `[FIX50SP2 §3]`, so
  with no dictionary the boundary is **undefined**, not merely unavailable — there is no sound
  wire-only rule to fall back on. Both reference engines decline for the same reason: QuickFIX C++
  returns from `Message::setGroup` when `DataDictionary::getGroup` fails and forms no `Group` at all;
  QuickFIX/J guards all three `parseGroup` call sites on a non-null dictionary and, with no
  dictionary, flattens the members as ordinary top-level fields.
  **⚠️ THE SURFACE THAT ACTUALLY CHANGED IS THE C++ TYPED ONE.** Stated first because an earlier
  draft of this row led with the C-ABI and called it "the only" visible change, which inverted the
  emphasis and was wrong as a universal claim. `MessageView::group<NoTag, GroupT>()` — the accessor
  every 2c-generated message class uses, e.g. `NewOrderList::orders()` — resolves through
  `group_slices()`, so on a dict-free view it now yields an **empty** `group_view<GroupT>` where it
  previously yielded wire-split instances whose last one absorbed trailing top-level fields. That is
  the change with real reach: **nine** test cells across `tests/wire`, `tests/codegen` and
  `tests/capi` were asserting non-empty typed groups off a dict-free parse and had to be rethreaded
  through a dictionary. If you consume fixpp from C++ and construct `Parser<access_mode::Index>{}`,
  this is the row that concerns you.

  **The C-ABI change, in proportion.** A dict-free caller's
  `fixpp_msg_get_group(msg, <group tag>, …)` went from `FIXPP_ERR_OK` **plus a cursor whose last
  nested instance absorbed trailing outer members** — a wrong value the caller could not distinguish
  from a real one — to `FIXPP_ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH`. `fixpp_group_get_nested_group` is unreachable in
  that state because there is no outer cursor to descend from. **No exported symbol, header, or enum
  changes; the 1.5.0 C-ABI freeze holds.** ⚠️ **And no shipped C entry point can reach it:** an
  inbound `fixpp_msg_t` is produced by `Session::parse_and_dispatch_`, which has been dict-backed
  since 066, so a dict-free handle exists only where a test constructs one directly. Zero C-ABI
  cells broke on this change; all nine that did were on the C++ typed path above. The C-ABI row is
  recorded for completeness and for anyone embedding the view types directly — not because it is the
  likely way to meet this. This **supersedes 065's FR-008**, whose bar was "no
  regression versus today's positional behaviour": 065 took the positional result as a floor because
  it was fixing the dict-aware path and would not touch the other one. #220 establishes that the
  positional result **was** the defect, so trading a silently wrong value for a defined refusal
  removes that floor rather than regressing against it. Witnessed by
  `MessageReadGroup.DictFreeGroupReadReportsTypeMismatch` (`tests/capi/message_read_test.cpp`),
  rewritten from 065's `DictFreeNestedReadDegradesToPositional` — which existed precisely to force
  this change to be made deliberately, and did.
  **Migration:** a caller that needs groups must construct through a dictionary
  (`Parser<access_mode::Index>{dict}`). A caller that does not need groups is unaffected.
  *(#220; replaces the rest-of-message degradation formerly recorded as L-085-1, now resolved.)*

### Limitations

- **L-220-1 — repeating groups are unavailable, not approximated, without a dictionary; and the
  per-instance DoS cap therefore does not apply on that path.** Two consequences of B-220-1, stated
  so neither is inferred:
  **(a)** A dict-free caller cannot enumerate group instances at all. Previously it got instances
  split on the wire delimiter — but the last one absorbed every trailing top-level field, so what it
  got was wrong rather than merely coarse (that was `L-085-1` / #220). There is no supported way to
  slice a group without membership; this is a deliberate removal of a wrong answer, not a deferred
  feature.
  **(b)** `Config::max_group_entries_per_instance` is a **dictionary-path cap only**. On the
  dict-free path nothing is measured, so nothing is capped — a dict-free table is bounded solely by
  `Config::max_offset_entries` (`build()`'s clamp), which is the real memory bound in any case. This
  is not a widened attack surface: no group is materialised on that path, so there is nothing per
  instance to bound.
  **What this row does NOT claim.** Two things, both untouched here and neither implied by the
  above. (i) `group_slices_status()`'s own instance splitter remains flat — that is `L-063-4` leg 1,
  descoped with evidence by 083. (ii) That splitter still resolves the instance delimiter from the
  WIRE when `group_delim_fn_` is null — filed as **fixpp#384**, because #220 removed the only case
  its stated justification covered. **RESOLVED 2026-09-07 by #384: see B-384-1 / B-384-2 below.**
  The shape survives, but it can no longer be built by omission, and its disposition is now written
  down rather than inherited. It was always a materially weaker concern than this row: that
  delimiter is membership-VALIDATED before use (`group()` proceeds only once `group_member_fn_`
  confirms the wire's first tag after the count is a member of the group), so it is always a
  confirmed member of the right group — the open question was whether it is the right MEMBER, which
  is 083's C-8.4 contract question, not this one.
  *(#220; `tests/wire/offset_table_test.cpp` — `DictFreeGroupDeclines*`, `DictFreeGroupSlicesAreEmpty`,
  `TrailingFieldNotCountedIntoLastInstance`, `FR001_NoFlatInstanceWalkInGroup`.)*

## fixpp#384 — the group delimiter oracle is no longer optional-by-omission (2026-09-07)

### Behaviors

- **B-384-1 — `group_delim_fn` has NO default on any dict-aware constructor.** The four public
  dict-aware constructors — `OffsetTable(frame, mr, dict, member_fn, delim_fn)`, its `Config`
  sibling, and `MessageView<Index>`'s two (`include/fixpp/wire/offset_table.hpp`,
  `include/fixpp/wire/parser.hpp`) — used to default their last parameter to `nullptr`. They no
  longer do. **This is a source-compatibility break for any caller that omitted the argument**; the
  fix is to name the argument. `Parser`'s dictionary constructor is unaffected — it installs
  both callbacks as unconditional member-initialisers, so no production construction and no
  `Parser`-mediated caller changes at all. (*"Has ALWAYS installed both"* would be false: the
  delimiter lambda arrived with 083 T057; before that the ctor installed `classify_fn_` and
  `group_member_fn_` only.) **RUNTIME behaviour is unchanged in both directions:**
  a caller who threads the oracle gets exactly what it got before, and a caller who now writes
  `nullptr` gets exactly what omission used to give. What changed is that the two are no longer
  spelled the same way.
  **Why this and not a decline — and a correction to the first answer that was written here.**
  Folding `group_delim_fn_ == nullptr` into `group()`'s #220 decline does turn
  `TypedReadSplitAgreement.OutOfScopeWireProbesUnchanged` RED (measured: 2 cells go red in
  total — that one, in `wire_dict_tests`, and #384's own new
  `GroupSlicesKeepsWireDelimiterWhenDelimStoreAnswersZero` in `wire_pure_tests`; the second is a
  cell this change introduced, which is not independent evidence), because that witness builds the
  half-threaded table
  **deliberately**, as its pre-083 oracle. ⚠️ **That measurement is NOT the reason, and offering it
  as one was an error of exactly the kind this issue is about.** The witness passes `nullptr` only
  as a spelling; by **B-384-2** a zero-returning oracle yields the same delimiter and the same
  slices, so the witness could be repaired in one line and the decline would stand. A cost that a one-line fixture change
  removes is not a design constraint.
  **The real reason is that the decline does not do what it is for.** Its goal is to remove the
  wire-derived split from a table that carries a dictionary. It cannot: a delimiter callback that
  ANSWERS 0 reaches the same fallback with the pointer non-null, so `group()` never declines. Option
  1 moves the un-informed spelling rather than removing the shape — and it pays for that with a
  supported degrade deleted. The same limit applies to B-384-1 itself and is stated there, not
  hidden: removing the default narrows the ACCIDENTAL spelling; the callback's answer space still
  contains a value equivalent to absence.
  **The deeper change, considered and deferred.** Bundling `(opaque_dict, group_member_fn,
  group_delim_fn)` into one aggregate with a both-or-neither invariant would collapse `group()`'s
  `opaque_dict_ == nullptr || group_member_fn_ == nullptr` disjunction to a single predicate — which
  is the structural cure for "a disjunct loses its subject", the mechanism that produced this issue.
  It is deferred, not rejected, on blast radius. **The radius is not enumerated here — an
  under-counted list is how a deferral becomes permanent, and a first attempt at one here was short
  by most of its real surface.** Re-derive it instead:
  `git grep -n 'opaque_dict\|group_member_fn\|group_delim_fn' -- include src` names every site that
  takes or reads the triple. Two of them decide the cost on their own: `entry_context`
  (`include/fixpp/wire/group_view.hpp`) is a **public, trivially-copyable** struct held by every
  generated `G_<no_tag>`, so the change reaches **codegen output**; and `Parser` carries its own
  copies of all three plus both `parse()` overloads. Residual (a) below is the piece of it that
  matters most.
  *(#384. **The population is not written down here, because removing the defaults IS the
  instrument that re-derives it: every half-threaded site is a build error.** To re-measure, delete
  the four `= nullptr` defaults on a tree and build. That recipe cannot go stale; a file list would,
  silently. What IS recorded is the shape of the answer at the time — **no `src/` or `include/` site
  was affected**, which is the reachability claim #384 opened with, measured rather than asserted.
  **Scope of that zero, so it is not read wider than it is:** the compile database covers `src/`,
  `tests/`, `tools/` **and generated `_codegen` sources** — the last is its largest bucket by TU
  count and the one a "delete the defaults and compile" pass would otherwise be assumed to miss; it
  constructs only the 2-arg dict-free `MessageView`. `bench/` and `tests/fuzz/` are **outside** it —
  `bench/` was enumerated by reading (every construction there is dict-free or default-constructed)
  and the fuzz harness by building the fuzz preset separately. A re-derivation that omits those two
  is incomplete. ⚠️ One class the compiler cannot see at all: a `MessageView` construction inside an
  **uninstantiated** template. A source sweep is the only cover for that, and it was run.)*

- **B-384-2 — with a delimiter oracle threaded, an answer of `0` leaves the WIRE-derived delimiter in
  place; it does not decline.** `group_slices_status()`'s guard is `if (d != 0) { delim = d; }`.
  083's C-8.4 row 2 asserted the opposite ("There is no wire fallback. A zero return means `no_tag`
  is not a group at all … which the caller already handles as absent"); that text described neither
  the code nor the state it runs in — the splitter is reached only **after** `group()`'s membership
  check has established that `no_tag` IS a group with members in this context, so a zero cannot mean
  "absent" there. A group with a non-empty member set and no first-field record is an **inconsistent
  dictionary**, and declining would drop instances membership just confirmed are present.
  **Reachability:** through the `dict::table_view_builder` surface only (`add_group_member`
  without `set_group_first` sets `group_bit` while leaving `group_first_` empty). A **loaded**
  dictionary cannot reach it. *(fixpp#456 renamed that surface — the mutators moved behind the
  builder — and did NOT close this row: `build()` runs no consistency check, so the builder still
  permits members without a first field. See `L-456-1`.)* ⚠️ **This row has now stated the reason WRONG TWICE, and both wrong
  versions are kept here, because the shape of the error is the thing #384 is about.**
  **First wrong version:** *"`as_table_view()` calls `set_group_first_ctx` before registering
  members."* Not load-bearing — `set_group_first_ctx` calls `add_group_member_ctx` itself, so
  ordering cannot separate the two.
  **Second wrong version:** *"the carrier is `members.empty() → continue` plus
  `capture_first_emission`, and the FR-023 sweep is NOT load-bearing because it never inspects
  `delimiter`."* The first half does not reach the code and the second half is backwards.
  `as_table_view()` never reads `capture_first_emission`'s output: it does a **store lookup**
  (`group_ctx_delimiter_impl`) and writes whatever comes back, **including 0**, unconditionally
  (`src/dictionary/dictionary.cpp`). The emission argument says nothing about whether that lookup
  hits.
  **The reason that actually holds, and it is two facts, not one:**
  **(1)** neither loader ever STORES a record with delimiter 0 — both guard the push on
  `captured != 0` (`src/dictionary/xml_loader.cpp`, `src/dictionary/orchestra_loader.cpp`, 083 T036 /
  FR-006 / C-6.1). So a 0 from the lookup can only mean *no record*. **(2)** the FR-023 / C-3.4
  completeness sweep in both loaders' `finalize()` **throws** if any context `as_table_view()` will
  register has no record. (1) + (2) ⇒ the delimiter written is non-zero. The FR-023 sweep is
  therefore one of the two braces, **not** a belt on top — the second wrong version above told the
  reader to discount the very guard that carries the claim, which is precisely the failure this
  whole row exists to document. `members.empty() → continue` still matters, but for a narrower job:
  it is what keeps a tolerantly-skipped group out of the registered set in the first place
  (`src/dictionary/orchestra_loader.cpp` states this in-source).
  ⚠️ **And it was found a THIRD time, in a file the first two corrections did not reach.** After
  both fixes above landed in this row and in `src/wire/offset_table.cpp`, a hostile review round
  found `specs/083-group-delimiter-resolution/contracts/typed_read_splitter.md` still asserting
  wrong version #1 verbatim in its #384 amendment — the correction had been applied where the
  reasoning was RE-DERIVED and missed where it had merely been RESTATED. **The lesson is not "check
  one more file": it is that a claim repeated in N places needs the fix driven from a search for the
  CLAIM, not from the place you happened to notice it.** Re-derive with
  `git grep -n 'set_group_first_ctx\|capture_first_emission' -- spec specs brain src include tests`.
  ⚠️ **And it was found a FOURTH time, by a recipe that was itself incomplete.** The line above
  originally omitted `tests` — the one directory holding the site it missed
  (`tests/wire/offset_table_test.cpp`, corrected under #389). The withdrawn carrier therefore
  SHIPPED in PR #390, in a comment block written by the same change that declared it false. **A
  re-derivation recipe is an instrument, and an instrument that cannot search where the defect lives
  fails toward clean** — the same class as every other instrument failure recorded here. The
  pathspec is now the full set; prefer no pathspec at all over a guessed one.
  ⚠️ Separately: `src/dictionary/orchestra_loader.cpp` carries a comment reading *"FR-023 (082) is
  NOT implemented here"* — that is a **different** FR-023 clause (082's group-detection removal),
  not the completeness sweep, which the same file does run in `finalize()`. The two sentences read
  as contradictory and are not.
  *(#384; `tests/wire/offset_table_test.cpp` —
  `GroupSlicesKeepsWireDelimiterWhenDelimStoreAnswersZero`, three arms: a control arm with a
  deliberately wrong non-zero oracle proving the callback is consulted at all, the zero arm, and an
  explicit-`nullptr` arm proving the two spellings agree. Mutation-proven RED both ways — dropping
  the `d != 0` guard, and short-circuiting the oracle lookup entirely.)*

### Limitations

- **L-384-1 — an explicitly half-threaded table still splits on the wire delimiter, and that split
  is WRONG on a divergent context.** Passing `nullptr` for `group_delim_fn` while passing a
  dictionary is supported and produces pre-083 behaviour. It is **not** justified as correct: on a
  context whose per-context delimiter differs from the globally-first-seen one, the half-threaded
  table and the fully-threaded one split the same frame DIFFERENTLY —
  `tests/wire/typed_read_split_agreement_test.cpp` `OutOfScopeWireProbesUnchanged` asserts both
  counts, so the figures live where something re-runs them rather than here. It is justified as **requested** — B-384-1 makes it unreachable by omission, so a caller
  gets it only by writing the null — and as **bounded**: the wire tag is membership-validated before
  use, so an arbitrary tag can never become the delimiter, and for a message conforming to FIX's
  "every instance opens with the group's first field" rule the wire tag and the dictionary's answer
  coincide. **⚠️ A zero-returning stub is NOT a threaded oracle** (B-384-2): it yields the same
  delimiter and the same slices as `nullptr`, so "we thread the callback everywhere" is a false
  claim if any of those callbacks answers 0. ⚠️ The equivalence is *in the split*, not in every
  respect — the callback is still INVOKED, so a stub that counts its calls is observable at its own
  counter while the split stays the un-informed one. Call-counting is therefore the wrong instrument
  for "is it threaded?", not a way around this. `tests/support/context_group_delim_fn.hpp` is the real one.
  **Two residuals this row records rather than fixes**, both examined and both deliberately left:
  **(a)** `OffsetTable::nested_group_slices`'s 7-arg overload takes `opaque_dict` and
  `group_member_fn` as ARGUMENTS but resolves `group_delim_fn_` from `this`. The sub-table is
  therefore built with the CALLER's dict pointer and the PARENT's delimiter callback, and that
  callback `static_cast`s the pointer to the dict type it expects — so a caller passing a foreign
  dictionary gets **type confusion**, not merely a wrong split. **Not reachable today, and
  consistent only by provenance rather than by construction:** the only production caller is the
  4-arg convenience overload, which forwards `this`'s own `opaque_dict_` / `group_member_fn_`, and
  `entry_context` is populated from a single `MessageView`. The pairing cannot even be *spelled*
  correctly, because the overload has no delimiter parameter. Same mismatched-pairing family as this
  row; **not closed by #384**, and the aggregate-parameter change described under B-384-1 is what
  would close it. **(b)** ⭐ **RESOLVED by #389 — see the disposition at the end of this row.
  The paragraphs below diagnose the DEFECT and are written in the present tense about the
  mechanism as it stood, not about shipped code.** ⚠️ **`group_slices_reserve_bound()`'s stated
  invariant is FALSE post-083, and the consequence is a STALE SPAN, not an extra allocation** — an earlier draft
  of this row said "one extra allocation", which understated it. The reserve exists so that
  *"subsequent appends never reallocate, so every previously returned span stays valid"*
  (`OffsetTable::group_slices_status`'s own comment). **TWO DIFFERENT DELIMITERS decide the two
  halves, and only one of them is capped** — this is sharper than the first version of this row,
  which said only "the bound sums declared counts while the loop is delimiter-driven".
  `consume_group_extent()` walks with the **WIRE** delimiter (`entries_[first].tag`) and *does* cap
  at `declared` (`inst < declared` in its `while`), producing `group_end`; `group_slices_status()`
  then RE-SPLITS `[first, group_end]` with the **DICTIONARY** delimiter under a loop whose only
  bound is `group_end` — one push per occurrence plus one at the end, **no `declared` cap at all**.
  `group_slices_reserve_bound()` bridged the two with the inference *"each contributes ≥ its actual
  pushes (consume_group_extent caps instances at `declared`)"*, and **that inference is the
  defect**: the cap governs the extent walk, the pushes happen in the split loop, and they use
  different delimiters. So on a divergent context the pushes exceed the reserve and
  `group_slices_` reallocates — invalidating every span already handed out for an earlier `no_tag`
  on the same table. **This is not hypothetical and not fuzz-only:**
  `TypedReadSplitAgreement.OutOfScopeWireProbesUnchanged` already produces **3** slices for a
  `100=2` group through a real `XmlLoader` dictionary and a real `Parser` — reserve bound 2, three
  pushes. What has kept it harmless so far is a caller-chosen allocator property the comment does
  not state: under a `monotonic_buffer_resource` the abandoned block is never reused, so the stale
  span still reads correct bytes. A resource that reuses would turn it into a use-after-free, and
  the C-ABI does hold such spans across calls. **PRE-EXISTING since 083 and NOT introduced,
  triggered, or fixed by #384** — recorded here because #384's review is where it was measured, and
  a residual nobody wrote down is how #384 itself happened. **FILED as fixpp#389** — this row is
  the disposition, not the tracking. ⚠️ **Widening the bound is NOT the obvious fix:** PR #181
  (Tier-2 `arena_fit`) tightened it deliberately, because the old conservative `entries_.size()`
  reserved up to `4096 * sizeof(group_slice)` out of a fixed, null-upstream parse arena — the
  arena-exhaustion defect #181 existed to fix. #389 carries the three candidate directions.
  ⭐ **RESOLVED 2026-09-07 by #389 — and NOT by widening the bound.** The estimator is DELETED.
  Each `no_tag` now materializes into its **own exact-sized array**, so there is no shared vector to
  reallocate and no second place that has to agree with the split loop. See **B-389-1**.
  *(#384 measured it, #389 fixed it; supersedes the (ii) clause of L-220-1.)*

## fixpp#419 — resend answers carry PossDupFlag(43)/OrigSendingTime(122) inside the standard header (2026-09-11)

### Behaviors

- **B-419-1 — both resend-answer emitters (`build_sequence_reset_gapfill`, `build_replay_frame`) now place `PossDupFlag(43)`/`OrigSendingTime(122)` before the first body field, not after it.** `build_sequence_reset_gapfill` emits them right after `TargetCompID(56)`. `build_replay_frame` inserts them at a safe point at or before the stored frame's header/body boundary: before the first stored tag NOT in `S = {8,34,35,49,52,56}` (9/10/43/122 are skipped/recomputed separately, never reaching this classification). This is a DELIBERATE deviation from the issue's "canonical header partition" suggestion — `S` is a small subset of the true FIX standard header, not the full table, chosen because correctness needs only `S ⊆` the real standard header (every real body tag then lies outside `S`, so the insertion point falls at-or-before the first body field) and a wider `S` would need a dictionary or a private FIXT-scoped table for no interop gain (neither QuickFIX-J nor QuickFIX-cpp validates order WITHIN the header — only header-before-body and that BeginString/BodyLength/MsgType lead). A strict peer (QuickFIX-J `UseDataDictionary=Y`) rejects a header field that follows a body field (`SessionRejectReason(373)=14`); both emitters now conform. *(fixpp#419; `src/session/admin_messages.cpp` `build_sequence_reset_gapfill`; `src/session/session.cpp` `build_replay_frame`; witness `tests/session/test_resend_answer_field_order.cpp`.)*

### Limitations

- *L-419-1 and L-419-2 were resolved on 2026-09-14 by fixpp#422 and fixpp#421 and moved to `spec/behaviors-and-limitations-closed.md`; see B-422-1, B-421-1 and B-421-2 in `## fixpp#421 / fixpp#422`.*

## fixpp#420 / fixpp#424 — a replay restamps SendingTime(52); an unbuildable replay is gap-filled (2026-09-14)

### Behaviors

- **B-420-1 — a replayed application message carries `SendingTime(52)` = the retransmission time and `OrigSendingTime(122)` = the stored `52`.** Before #420 the stored `52` was copied through unchanged, so a replay carried `52 == 122 == the original send time`, and a replay older than the peer's MaxLatency was rejected (`Reject 373=10, 371=52` + Logout). The inbound SendingTime check covers PossDup frames in fixpp, QuickFIX-J and QuickFIX-cpp (`isGoodTime`). FIX Session Layer 2020 §4.8.4 requires the restamp: the retransmitted message carries the original sending time in `OrigSendingTime` and the current time in `SendingTime`. The stamp is taken per replayed message at the configured `sending_time_precision`. A Session with no clock has no stamp and keeps the stored `52`. 013 FR-010's "byte-for-byte" clause governs `122` and still holds; 037 FR-006/SC-003's "replayed application frames byte-identical to prior behavior" no longer holds. The interop golden profiles exclude `52` and `122`, so no golden changes. *(fixpp#420; `src/session/session.cpp` `build_replay_frame` + `replay_outbound_range_`; witnesses `tests/session/test_resend_answer_field_order.cpp` `Replay_OlderThanPeerMaxLatency_AcceptedByAFixppPeer`, `tests/session/test_send_allow_pos_dup_strip.cpp` Cell 3, `tests/session/test_sending_time_precision.cpp` `OrigSendingTime122_PreservedVerbatim_OnResend`.)*
- **B-424-1 — a stored application message with no `SendingTime(52)` is replayed with `52` and `122` both set to the retransmission stamp.** Before #424 it was replayed with no `52` and an empty `122`. A stored `52` that is present but empty counts as not available too: it is restamped in place, no `52` is inserted, and `122` takes the stamp, so a stored frame with one `52` replays with one `52`. A stored frame with several `52` fields keeps all of them, each restamped, and `122` follows the first. FIX StandardHeader, `OrigSendingTime`: *"If data is not available set to same value as SendingTime"*. Reachable only through a custom or corrupted `MessageStore`, because `Session::send()` always stamps `52` when a clock is present. *(fixpp#424; witnesses `Replay_NoStoredSendingTime_Emits52And122FromTheResendClock`, `Replay_EmptyStoredSendingTime_CarriesExactlyOne52`.)*
- **B-424-2 — a stored application message whose replay frame cannot be built is folded into the surrounding `SequenceReset-GapFill` run, and `session_event_resend_slot_gap_filled{seq, code}` is appended to `Session::recent_events()`.** Before #424 the slot was skipped silently: no replay and no GapFill, so the peer's gap never closed (FIX-SL §4.8.3/§4.8.5 require a resend answer to eliminate every gap). The replay is built before the open gap run is flushed, so the slot extends that run instead of splitting it. **Reachability:** every `SendingTime(52)` field in the stored frame is restamped, so a frame that fits the capture buffer can still outgrow the replay buffer when it carries many `52` fields, or `52` values shorter than the stamp (`wire_field_value_truncated`); `Session::send()` never produces such a frame, so this takes a custom or corrupted `MessageStore`. A Session with no clock replaying a stored frame that has no `52` also reaches the fold (`wire_required_field_missing`). That is a direct-`Session` posture only, because `Engine::open` rejects a null clock, and the GapFill it emits carries an empty `52`/`122`, as every admin frame of a clock-less Session does. A write failure while answering the resend is not folded: it ends the answer with `dispatch_aborted`. *(fixpp#424 D4a; `include/fixpp/session/session_event.hpp`; witnesses `Replay_ManyStoredSendingTimes_OutgrowTheBuffer_SlotIsGapFilled`, `Replay_BufferEndSweep_SlotIsReplayedWholeOrGapFilled`, `Replay_NoClockAndNoStoredSendingTime_SlotIsGapFilled`, `Replay_UnbuildableSlot_JoinsTheSurroundingGapFillRun`, `ResendAnswer_WriteFails_Aborts_AtEachTransmitSite`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-424-1 — a stored frame too large to capture still aborts the resend answer and disconnects (`dispatch_aborted`) instead of being gap-filled.** The owner kept this deliberately (fixpp#424 D5, 2026-09-14): the store holds a business message the engine cannot retransmit, and a GapFill would tell the peer that message never mattered. The disconnect makes the condition loud. **Status: deferred, may be reopened.** *(fixpp#424 D5; `replay_outbound_range_`'s `cv.truncated` branch.)*

## fixpp#421 / fixpp#422 — send() rejects a non-canonical payload tag; header-class payload fields go out inside the header (2026-09-14)

### Behaviors

- **B-421-1 — `Session::send` rejects a payload field whose tag is empty, contains a non-digit, has a leading zero, or exceeds 65535, with `app_payload_malformed` (131); no MsgSeqNum is consumed and nothing is transmitted.** Before #421 any digit-only tag was accepted and stored as written: a peer reads `052=` as `52`, and the resend replay wrote `65588=` as `52=`, because the wire writer takes a 16-bit tag. `65535` itself is accepted. *(fixpp#421; `src/session/session.cpp` `parse_outbound_tag`, `send_impl`; witnesses `tests/session/test_resend_answer_field_order.cpp` `Send_AliasingTag_RejectedWithoutConsumingASeqNum`, `Send_TagWithANonDigitBelowZero_Rejected`.)*
- **B-421-2 — a stored application message carrying a digit-only tag that is empty, has a leading zero, or exceeds 65535 is not replayed; its slot is gap-filled (B-424-2) with `session_event_resend_slot_gap_filled{code = wire_tag_out_of_range}`.** Before #421 the tag was replayed as a different one (`65588` and `4294967348` as `52`, `052` as `52`, an empty tag as `0`). `Session::send` no longer stores such a frame (B-421-1), so this takes a store written by an older build or a custom `MessageStore`. A clock-less Session replaying such a frame with no stored `52` reports `wire_tag_out_of_range` too, not `wire_required_field_missing`. A stored field with no `=` or with a non-digit tag is still dropped from the replay, as before. Supersedes 040 FR-008's "justified exclusion" of this scanner. *(fixpp#421; `build_replay_frame`; witnesses `Replay_StoredTagAbove65535_SlotIsGapFilled`, `Replay_StoredTagWrappingUint32_SlotIsGapFilled`, `Replay_StoredTagWithLeadingZero_SlotIsGapFilled`, `Replay_StoredEmptyTag_SlotIsGapFilled`, `Replay_StoredTagAbove65535_NoClockAndNo52_ReportsTheTag`, `Replay_MalformedStoredFields_DroppedNotGapFilled`.)*
- **B-422-1 — `Session::send` emits the payload's header-class fields directly after `TargetCompID(56)`, in the caller's order, followed by its other fields in the caller's order.** Header-class means the `<header>` of `dictionaries/FIXT11.xml` plus `OnBehalfOfSendingTime(370)`, which QuickFIX-J's `Message.isHeaderField` also counts. Before #422 such a field went out wherever the caller placed it, and a strict peer rejects a header field that follows a body field. Measured 2026-09-14 against QuickFIX-J 3.0.1 with `UseDataDictionary=Y`: a NewOrderSingle carrying `50=` after its body fields drew `35=3 … 58=Tag specified out of required order, field=50|371=50|373=14` from `origin/main`, and was accepted with the fix. With `allow_pos_dup=true` a caller's `43`/`122` move the same way (B-022-1). Rejected alternative: failing such a send with `app_payload_malformed`. *(fixpp#422, owner decision 2026-09-14; `src/session/session.cpp` `is_send_header_tag`, `send_impl` T009; witnesses `Send_HeaderTagsAfterBody_GoOutInsideTheHeader_AllowPosDup`, `Send_HeaderTagsAfterBody_GoOutInsideTheHeader_DefaultStrip`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-422-1 — the header-class tag set is fixed in the engine; the session's dictionary is not consulted.** A custom dictionary whose header declares a field outside that set gets no reordering for it, so a strict peer can still reject that field when the caller places it after a body field. *(fixpp#422; `is_send_header_tag`.)*

## fixpp#423 — an in-sequence rejected message consumes its MsgSeqNum (2026-09-14)

### Behaviors

- **B-423-1 — In `LogonReceived`/`Active`, an inbound message answered with `Reject(35=3)` at the expected inbound MsgSeqNum consumes that number. The expected inbound seqnum advances by one and the advance is persisted, as for a delivered message.**
  - **Which Rejects:** every one issued before the sequence-number check:
    - the 041 dictionary validation gate (B-041-1);
    - the SendingTime accuracy check (B-021-2);
    - 021's PossDup checks: a missing or unparseable `OrigSendingTime(122)` (Arm C) and `122 > 52` (Arm D).

    This includes the SendingTime Reject and Arm D, which then Logout and disconnect. Rejects issued after the sequence-number check already consumed the number (thorny C-102, `qfj-557-generatereject-advances-seqnum_test.cpp`). Two of them, the `fromAdmin` veto of an admin message and the Reject of an application message when no `Application` is registered, advanced it only in memory; #423 persists those too, so a restart does not ask for the rejected message again.
  - **Not consumed:**
    - a rejected message at any other number;
    - a rejected Logon(35=A) or SequenceReset(35=4), which both QuickFIX engines' `generateReject` also exclude;
    - anything rejected by the validate gates of the establishment arms (`NotConnected`, `LogonSent`).
  - **If persisting the advance fails,** the session disconnects before the Reject is sent.
  - **Before #423** none of these Rejects consumed the number, so the peer's next message looked like a gap. fixpp sent a ResendRequest, rejected the replay again, and stopped delivering application messages. Measured live against QuickFIX-cpp on 2026-09-11: one ResendRequest, two Rejects for the same seq, zero `fromApp` deliveries over a 35 s window.
  - **Sources:**
    - FIX Session Layer 2020 §4.5.4: "Rejected messages must be logged and NextNumIn incremented by 1".
    - FIX Session Test Cases 2020, cases 2f, 2g and 14a–h: "Increment NextNumIn".
  - **Supersedes:**
    - 041 contract C-3's and FR-003's "does not advance seqnum state";
    - 021 FR-004's at-expected "MUST NOT advance … matches QuickFIX".

    The parity claim was false: QuickFIX-J and QuickFIX-cpp both increment at the expected number.
  - **Rejected alternative:** "no advance, QuickFIX parity".

  - Recovery moves on to the next number and does not ask for the rejected message again.
  - If that was the last missing number, the resend ends.
  - The rejected message is not delivered to the application.

## 089-quickfix-interop-conversation — committed evidence provenance (2026-09-12)

### Limitations

- **L-089-1 — the committed 400-witness `witness_evidence.yaml` artifact's `script_digest` is bound to the live conversation script; its counterparty fields are not, and the artifact attests nothing about the fixpp revision that produced it.** The `runs:` ledger schema records `counterparty_flavour`, `counterparty_version`, `counterparty_digest` and `script_digest`, but no fixpp source revision, source manifest or candidate-binary digest. `script_digest` is bound against the current `conversation_script.yaml` (`_check_script_digest_binding` hashes the live file's bytes every run — a real attestation). `counterparty_flavour`/`counterparty_version`/`counterparty_digest` are recorded and joined internally (manifest ↔ ledger, `MANIFEST_LEDGER_JOIN_FIELDS`) but verified against no external truth: no in-repo operand exists to bind the counterparty image digest against — the same "operand absent" disposition already documented for `evidence_digest`/`evidence_relpath` (`_check_witness_run_join`'s docstring, `tests/interop/cell_results_schema_check_test.py`). An edit to `witness_comparator.cpp`, `readback_jsonl.hpp` or `build_replay_frame` leaves the committed 400-pass artifact untouched and still gated green, now describing a tree that no longer exists, and no instrument anywhere can notice. **Status: deferred.** Gating a `subject_digest` (a hash over the small named set of inputs that can invalidate the evidence) is the right end state, but is blocked until a CI lane can regenerate the matrix against a live counterparty (fixpp#431 — every current CI lane SKIPs the conversation cells without one); until that lane exists, gating the digest today would redden CI on unrelated `session.cpp` edits with no satisfiable fix available in CI (the local matrix regeneration the digest would demand cannot run there). → **fixpp#431**.

## fixpp#413 / #416 / #417 — lint and format sweep, `FIXPP_WERROR` wired (2026-09-14)

### Behaviors

- **B-417-1 — With `FIXPP_WERROR=ON`, a compiler warning now FAILS the build of every first-party target.** Before #417 the option was set by every preset inheriting `_base` in `CMakePresets.json` but read by nothing, so no build was ever `-Werror`. `fixpp_apply_werror_to_all_targets()` (`cmake/Helpers.cmake`) now applies `-Werror` (Clang/GNU) or `/WX` (MSVC) to every compiled target the tree defines — library, tests, tools, bench, fuzz and the Python bindings. **Operator impact:** building fixpp from source with a compiler that introduces a new warning now fails where it used to succeed; the escape is `-DFIXPP_WERROR=OFF`. Which presets set the option is decided in `CMakePresets.json` — re-derive it there rather than from a list here. For almost every target the promoted set is the compiler's **default** warnings; `-Wall`/`-Wextra` are not enabled. A target opts out only individually, with the reason in the `FIXPP_WERROR_EXEMPT` target property.
- **B-417-2 — `FIXPP_BUILD_BENCH` and `FIXPP_BUILD_FUZZ` now build with `FIXPP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`.** `bench/session` and `tests/fuzz` link `fixpp_mock_clock`, which was built only when tests were enabled, so either option with tests off failed at link time (`cannot find -lfixpp_mock_clock`). The test-support library is now built whenever tests, bench or fuzz are enabled. Found while building the optional parts under `-Werror` for #417.

## fixpp#426 / fixpp#427 / fixpp#428 — Length+Data pairs read by count everywhere; C-ABI Data setters (C-ABI 1.6, BREAKING) (2026-09-15)

### Behaviors

- **B-426-1 — every field scanner reads a Data value by its Length's count, over one standard table of 84 Length+Data pairs.**
  - **Before #426:** the wire parser knew six pairs, and the session's own scanners split every value at SOH.
  - **Now it is one rule everywhere:**
    - a Data value is counted only when it is the field right after its Length;
    - a counted value must be followed by SOH inside the span being scanned. `field_iterator` (Iter) also accepts a counted value that ends exactly at the end of its span: the C-ABI group read hands it a group slice, and a slice excludes the entry's terminal SOH. Index and the session scanners have no such exception.
  - **Who applies it:**
    - `OffsetTable` (Index) and `field_iterator` (Iter);
    - `dictionary_driven_validator`;

    A `<SOH>34=`, `<SOH>49=`, `<SOH>554=` or `<SOH>10=` inside a counted value is not a field.

  |---|---|
  | Header scan, first-frame ID scan, `interpret_logon` | Stop; every later field stays absent rather than possibly forged. |

- **B-426-3 — a dictionary's own Length+Data pair is honoured only when neither of its tags is in the standard table.** The standard pair governs both directions otherwise. The session's dictionary supplies its pairs to the wire parser, the validator, reified handles and the session scanners through one `wire::dict_hooks` value. *(fixpp#426 design §3; `dict_hooks::data_tag_for_length` / `length_tag_for_data`; witnesses `tests/wire/dict_hooks_custom_pair_test.cpp` `CustomPairSplitsThroughEveryDictAwarePath`, `StandardLengthTagIgnoresConflictingDictionaryPair`, `StandardDataTagIsNeverPairedByADictionary`, `LengthTagForDataIsTheInverseWithTheSamePrecedence`.)*
- **B-427-1 — the Orchestra (FIX Latest) loader reads `lengthId`, so FIX Latest Data fields pair with their Length fields.**
  - **Before #427:** a FIX Latest dictionary declared no pairs.
  - **The load fails closed (`orchestra_parse_error`) when a `lengthId`:**
    - names an undeclared field;
    - names a field that is not a Length;
    - sits on a field that is not Data or XMLData;
    - is malformed;
    - or when two Data fields share one Length.

- **B-428-1 — BREAKING (C-ABI 1.6, constitution Article X §7): `fixpp_msg_set_string` and `fixpp_entry_set_string` refuse a value holding SOH on a tag that is not the Data half of a pair, with `FIXPP_ERR_WIRE_CONFORMANCE`; nothing is written.** Before #428 such a value was stored, and its SOH started a new field on the wire. Other control bytes are still accepted (L-428-1). *(fixpp#428; `src/capi/message_write.cpp` `soh_outside_data`; witnesses `tests/capi/length_data_setters_test.cpp` `CapiStringSetterSoh.*`.)*
- **B-428-2 — BREAKING (C-ABI 1.6): `fixpp_msg_commit` refuses, with `FIXPP_ERR_WIRE_CONFORMANCE`, a payload in which, whichever setter wrote it:**
  - a Data field is not immediately after its Length, or a Length is not immediately before its Data;
  - a Length is not positive ASCII digits equal to the Data byte count (leading zeros are accepted);
  - a Data value is empty;
  - a field that is not Data holds SOH.

  The rule applies inside group instances too. *(fixpp#428; `check_length_data`, `include/fixpp/wire/length_data_check.hpp` `length_data_checker`; witnesses `CapiCommitPairs.*`.)*
- **B-428-3 — `fixpp_msg_set_data` / `fixpp_entry_set_data` (new in C-ABI 1.6) write a Length+Data pair in one call.** The Length is derived from `len` and the bytes are copied verbatim.
  - **Neither half present:** the Length is appended, then the Data.
  - **Length immediately before Data:** both are overwritten in place.
  - **Any other state:** `FIXPP_ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH`, and nothing is written.

  No existing entry moves, so an open group builder keeps its position. Refusals:
  - `len == 0` → `FIXPP_ERR_WIRE_CONFORMANCE`;
  - a tag that is not a Data half → `FIXPP_ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH`;
  - a Data tag whose paired Length tag is a framing tag (reachable only with a custom dictionary) → `FIXPP_ERR_MSG_FRAMING_TAG_FORBIDDEN`;
  - a half absent from the MsgType's grammar → `FIXPP_ERR_DICT_CONFIG` (message level);
  - a Data tag that is its group's delimiter in that group's own context (MsgType plus enclosing groups, as commit resolves it) → `FIXPP_ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH`.

  A value holding SOH, `10=` and 0xFF arrives byte-exact at a second engine. *(fixpp#428; witnesses `CapiSetData.*`, `CapiEntrySetData.*`, `tests/capi/length_data_send_recv_test.cpp` `EncodedTextWithEmbeddedSohArrivesByteExact`.)*
- **B-428-4 — BREAKING (C-ABI 1.6): `fixpp_msg_create_outbound` refuses an empty MsgType, or one holding SOH, with `FIXPP_ERR_WIRE_CONFORMANCE`.** A session with a dictionary already refused both with `FIXPP_ERR_DICT_CONFIG`, and still does. Before #428, a session without a dictionary accepted such a MsgType, and commit wrote it verbatim, so `D<SOH>11=X` went out as two fields. *(fixpp#428, Gate B r1 G-1; witness `CapiCreateOutbound.DictFreeSessionRefusesAnEmptyOrSohMsgType`.)*
- **B-457-1 — both dictionary loaders refuse a field numbered 0.** `XmlLoader` throws `dict::xml_parse_error` (`dict_xml_parse_failed`) on `<field number='0'>`, **reusing the existing out-of-range message verbatim**, so a caller already handling `<field number='70000'>` needs no new arm. The Orchestra loader throws `dict::orchestra_parse_error` on `<fixr:field id="0">` with a **distinct** message — `<fixr:field> id must be 1..65535, got 0` — because there is no out-of-range message to reuse there: `try_parse_uint16` collapses missing, malformed and out-of-range into one "missing/invalid" string, and a present, well-formed `id="0"` is none of those. Before #457 both admitted it: the XML bound was `tag_i < 0 || tag_i > 65535` and Orchestra's id parse was a plain `uint16`. A FIX tag is positive, and 0 is additionally the "absent" answer of `length_pair_data_tag`, `data_pair_length_tag` and `group_first_field`, so a zero-numbered field read as present or absent depending on the direction asked. **The rule is applied at the DECLARATION only, and deliberately not to every numeric id:** `<fixr:component id>` and `<fixr:group id>` (and their refs) are a repository-local surrogate key, not a FIX tag, and `id="0"` stays legal there — which is why the Orchestra rule lives in `parse_orchestra_field_tag` rather than in the shared `parse_orchestra_id`. No reference to a field (`<fixr:fieldRef>`, `<fixr:numInGroup>`, `lengthId=`) can resolve to 0, because 0 can no longer be declared — though which guard reports it differs by reference kind: `lengthId=` is caught earlier, by the retained zero-pair guard in `resolve_length_pairs` (witness `OrchestraFailClosed.ZeroLengthIdCannotBeHalfOfAPair`). **This is a compatibility break for third-party dictionaries, and the break is the point of the change:** a hand-written or vendor dictionary that declares a zero-numbered field loaded before and is now refused at load. No **vendored** dictionary declares such a field, so the break is invisible in CI by construction — which is exactly why it is stated here rather than inferred from a green matrix. (In-tree *fixtures* do declare one: they are this row's own negative witnesses. Re-derive either set with a repo-wide search for `number='0'` / `<fixr:field id="0">` rather than trusting a census written here.) A caller that must keep loading such a dictionary has to renumber the field; there is no opt-out, because the accessors that answer 0 for "absent" cannot represent it. *(fixpp#457; `src/dictionary/xml_loader.cpp` `<field number>` parse, `src/dictionary/orchestra_loader.cpp` `parse_orchestra_field_tag`; witnesses `tests/dictionary/negative_paths_test.cpp` `NegativePaths.ZeroFieldNumberThrowsXmlParseError` / `ZeroVersionNumbersAndTagOneAreStillAccepted`, `tests/dictionary/orchestra_loader_test.cpp` `OrchestraFailClosed.ZeroFieldIdThrows` / `ZeroStructuralXmlIdsAreStillAccepted` / `ZeroLengthIdCannotBeHalfOfAPair`, `tests/wire/dict_hooks_custom_pair_test.cpp` `DictHooksCustomPair.ZeroIsRefusedAtDeclarationBeforeAPairCanForm`.)*

- **B-456-1 — a `fixpp::dict::table_view`'s population surface is sealed, and the type is non-assignable, once built.** The population surface is as `table_view.hpp`'s STORAGE banner states. Seat a `std::optional<table_view>` with `emplace`, not with assignment. Copy- and move-CONSTRUCTION are unchanged and remain load-bearing (`wire::dictionary_driven_validator` holds its view by value) — so a view the holder does not declare `const` can still be moved from, and an `optional<table_view>` re-seated with `emplace` substitutes a new object at the same address (`B-456-2`). This is a **source-breaking** change to a public C++ type; it is **not** a C-ABI change — `table_view` appears in no `include/fix/` header, so no C-ABI version moves. A direct call to one of the former mutators on a `table_view`, or a direct use of either assignment operator, is a compile error naming the member (`'add_valid' is a private member of 'fixpp::dict::table_view'`, `object of type 'table_view' cannot be assigned`) — that is what `tests/dictionary/table_view_seal_compile_test.cpp` asserts. Two other break shapes are neither at the call site nor covered by that witness. An assignment mediated by a container or algorithm (`std::vector<table_view>::operator=`, `std::sort`, `std::swap`) diagnoses inside the standard library. And the type's traits change: `is_copy_assignable_v`, `is_move_assignable_v` and `is_swappable_v` all become false, so `std::movable`, `std::copyable` and `std::semiregular` are no longer satisfied — out-of-tree code constrained on those, or branching on the traits with `if constexpr`, keeps compiling and selects a different path. Whether that is observable is a property of the consumer's code, not of this change. *(fixpp#456, `.specify/456-table-view-seal.md` §5a; witness `tests/dictionary/table_view_seal_compile_test.cpp`.)*
- **B-456-2 — a `wire::dict_hooks` bundle latches `has_nonstandard_pair()` at build time, and that latch can still go stale through a re-seated `optional<table_view>`.** What changed is narrower than this row first stated. `for_table_view` stores `std::addressof(dict)` and latches exactly one thing from the view: whether to install the Length/Data-pair callback, from `has_nonstandard_pair()`. Every other callback — and the pair callback's own answers — dereferences the stored address on each call, so a destroy-and-reconstruct in the same storage is followed by all of them. The single transition an existing bundle cannot see is pair-free → pair-bearing: its `length_pair_` is null, and `data_tag_for_length` returns 0 before it reaches the address. In production the re-seatable holders are the `std::optional<table_view>` members — `owning_message_handle::impl::owned_tv_` (declared and seated in `src/dictionary/reify.cpp`) and `fixpp_msg::owned_tv_` (declared in `src/capi/capi_internal.hpp`, seated in `src/capi/message_write.cpp`). Each is seated exactly once, under `assert(!….has_value())` — enforcement **by construction plus a debug assert**, not by the type; `assert` is stripped under `NDEBUG`. Re-derive the set: `grep -rnE 'optional<.*table_view>' src/ include/`. `wire::dictionary_driven_validator::dict_` and `dict::dictionary_snapshot::view_` also hold a non-`const` view by value, but as plain members they cannot be re-seated at all now that assignment is deleted. `DictHooksCustomPair.ABundleIsASnapshotOfTheDictionaryItWasBuiltFrom` was deleted on the claim that its premise was unconstructible. That claim was wrong: the *population* half became unconstructible, the *identity* half did not. `DictHooksCustomPair.ABundleKeepsItsNullPairCallbackAcrossAReSeatThatAddsThePair` carries it now. Separately, a non-`const` view can still be **moved from**, which empties the source rather than changing it (§5b). §7's raw `opaque_dict_` lifetime hole is the same shape; the seal neither causes nor cures any of them. *(fixpp#456 §5c / §5d item 5. This row exists to record what stopped being observable; a green suite is not evidence that half was ever covered.)*

### Limitations

- **L-426-1 — custom dictionary pairs are not honoured where no dictionary is reachable.** That is pre-session routing (`scan_first_frame_ids`) and redaction at the logger, tap and transcript sites (`redact_tag554`). Both use the standard table alone. *(fixpp#426 design §7.)*
- **L-426-2 — a dictionary that repurposes a standard Length+Data tag is not honoured for pairing.** Examples are one that types RawData(96) as STRING, or one that pairs SignatureLength(93) with a custom Data tag. The standard pair governs both parsing and commit. *(design §3, r3 R3-1.)*
- **L-426-3 — QuickFIX interop.**
  - QuickFIX finds a Data field's Length as `tag - 1`, and QuickFIX C++ sends inverted pairs Data-first. For those FIX50SP2 and FIX Latest pairs fixpp splits the value at SOH, as the standard requires.
  - Both QuickFIX engines split XmlData at SOH.

  *(design §0, §7.)*
- **L-428-1 — the C-ABI string setters and `fixpp_msg_commit` accept C0 control bytes other than SOH, and 0x80–0xFF.** That is looser than TagValue §4.1 and than the C++ builder; it is a compatibility choice. *(design §7; witness `CapiStringSetterSoh.OtherControlBytesAreStillAccepted`.)*
- L-067-2 is unchanged: the C++ `body_builder` still cannot emit a non-ASCII Data value (fixpp#418).
- **L-456-1 — `table_view_builder::build()` performs no consistency validation.** A builder can still produce an internally inconsistent table; the known shape is a group with members and no first field (`B-384-2`), reached by calling `add_group_member` without `set_group_first`. The seal governs reachability, not consistency: `build()` is `return std::move(tv_);` and checks nothing. *(fixpp#456 §5c. A consistency check inside `build()` was considered and left out of scope.)*
- **L-456-2 — on the Microsoft STL a `table_view` move is not `noexcept`, and nothing in the type says so.** `std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<fixpp::dict::table_view>` is **false** under MSVC and **true** under libstdc++ and libc++. The deciding members are the **ten hash containers** — `group_first_`, `group_members_`, `group_required_members_`, `group_ctx_`, `types_`, `enums_`, `fixt_framing_tags_`, `fixt_framing_types_`, `length_pair_data_tag_`, `data_pair_length_tag_` — because the Microsoft STL does not declare `unordered_map`/`unordered_set` move construction `noexcept`. Measured on MSVC 14.44.35207 (`_MSC_VER` 1944): every `std::vector`, `std::string`, hash, equality functor and allocator involved **is** nothrow-move, so the cause is the hash containers themselves and not this type's use of them. Re-derive on any toolchain with `static_assert(std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<std::unordered_map<std::uint16_t, std::uint16_t>>);` — the answer is a property of the STL, not of fixpp.

  ⚠️ **What this costs, and who pays it.** The move paths are `table_view_builder::build() &&`, `std::optional<table_view>::emplace` — a generic move path; no production copy site uses it after fixpp#495 (condition: `grep -rnE "optional<.*table_view|owned_tv_\.emplace" src include` has no hit outside a comment) — the by-value seat in `wire::dictionary_driven_validator`'s constructor, and, since fixpp#495 D-4, the snapshot's move of its table into the table's own `make_shared` block (it replaced the move into the snapshot's member, same count). *(Amended 2026-09-23, fixpp#486:)* the validator constructor is now specified `noexcept(std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<table_view>)` (`B-486-1`), so where the move is not nothrow the constructor no longer promises `noexcept`. T-1's MSVC leg ran: on MSVC 14.44 the constructor is `noexcept(false)` (the design note's Q-2 is decided), and the unfixed constructor fails T-1's `static_assert` (`C2338`). That a failing member move then propagates `bad_alloc` follows from the specification and is not witnessed behaviourally. What remains open here is that the type does not say its move can throw. *(Superseded wording:)* that constructor was declared **`noexcept`** while move-constructing its member, so on MSVC a throwing move there was `std::terminate` rather than a propagated exception. ⚠️ **fixpp#456 did not introduce this.** Before it, `table_view` declared `table_view(table_view&&) noexcept = default;`, and since P1286R2 an explicit exception specification on a defaulted special member simply **wins** over the inferred one — so MSVC builds already carried a move promising `noexcept` over ten members that promise nothing of the kind. What fixpp#456 changed is that the promise is no longer made, so the divergence is now **visible** instead of masked. The `static_assert` that would have asserted it is removed rather than respelled, and the explicit `noexcept` is deliberately **not** restored: it would re-hide the fact on every lane without making any move safer. *(fixpp#456 §3.2/§7, which wrote this disposition before the measurement existed; see `include/fixpp/dict/table_view.hpp`'s note where the assertion stood. The `noexcept` on the validator constructor was pre-existing and out of fixpp#456's scope; fixpp#486 made it conditional.)*

## fixpp#447 / #458 / #452 — three C-ABI calls that must refuse (C-ABI 1.7, BREAKING) (2026-09-21)

### Behaviors

- **B-447-1 — BREAKING (C-ABI 1.7): `fixpp_msg_remove_tag` refuses with `FIXPP_ERR_INVALID_HANDLE` while any group builder is open, and erases nothing.** Two failure modes trigger the guard: erasing a scalar tag while a builder is open, where the erasure would shift a later group entry's index out from under the builder holding it; and erasing the NoXXX count tag of the open group itself, the tag an `AccumulatorEntry` is matched on. On refusal the accumulator's `entries` are unchanged and every open builder stays usable. **Migration:** move the `remove_tag` call before the matching `fixpp_entry_group_begin`, or after its `fixpp_entry_group_end`. **The guard's true width includes two refused-but-safe classes**, distinguished from its trigger rather than exempted from it: an absent tag with a builder open still refuses (idempotence does not apply once any builder is open); a present tag positioned after every live root's group entry still refuses, even though erasing it in isolation would not shift any group's index. The guard is keyed on the builder stack being non-empty, not on the erased tag or its position. *(fixpp#447, 090-capi-refusals D-1; `src/capi/message_write.cpp`; witnesses `tests/capi/message_write_test.cpp` seams 1a/1b/2/2b.)*
- **B-458-1 — BREAKING (C-ABI 1.7): `fixpp_msg_clone` refuses when a dict-backed source's re-parse fails, instead of returning a silently dict-free clone.** The refusal surfaces one of three already-published codes via `translate()`'s image of the `core::error` the failed re-parse produced — `FIXPP_ERR_WIRE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, `FIXPP_ERR_WIRE_INVALID_FRAME`, or `FIXPP_ERR_UNKNOWN` for the out-of-memory route (documented v1.0 behaviour — see **L-049-2**). `*clone_out` is `NULL` and the source handle is unchanged and still usable. **Also: clone's exception boundary is now NESTED, not a flat blanket catch.** An OUTER `catch (...)` in clone's own body logs fatally and calls `std::abort()`, matching every other steady-state C-ABI symbol; an INNER `catch (std::bad_alloc const&)` around clone's own construction returns `FIXPP_ERR_CAPI_CONFIG_INVALID`, preserving the shipped OOM pin. A non-`std::bad_alloc` exception raised inside clone's construction — previously returned as `FIXPP_ERR_CAPI_CONFIG_INVALID` from the blanket catch — now reaches the outer catch and **terminates the process after a fatal log**. Its trigger set is **not enumerated**: whether such an exception can be produced on clone's path at all is undecided. *(fixpp#458, 090-capi-refusals D-3/D-3b; `src/capi/message_write.cpp`; witnesses `tests/capi/message_write_test.cpp` seam 3, `tests/capi/dict066_clone_membership_copy_oom_test.cpp` seam 3b arm A.)*
- **B-458-2 — BREAKING for a direct C++ caller (`[C++ track]`): the dict-backed reify factory materialises eagerly and returns `unexpected` on a failed dict-backed re-parse.** `fixpp::dict::detail::owning_message_handle_from_frame` — and therefore `fixpp::dict::reify()` and the generated dispatch — now refuses with the wire error the failed re-parse produced, instead of returning a handle whose first `view()` silently degraded. **Exactly what is NOT covered:** a handle minted from a **dict-free** source still materialises and still returns, reporting a failed `OffsetTable` build through the already-public `view().offsets().build_status()`; a handle minted over a span that **frames to nothing** — including a zero-byte span — still materialises and still returns, with a default-constructed empty view. Both are shipped, pinned behaviour this change leaves alone. A separate row from B-458-1 because the two halves of #458 ride different tracks (C-ABI vs `[C++ track]`), not because they behave differently — under this change they behave the same. *(fixpp#458, 090-capi-refusals D-4; `src/dictionary/reify.cpp`, `include/fixpp/dict/reify.hpp`; witnesses `tests/dictionary/reify_dispatch_test.cpp` arms (i-a)/(i-b)/(ii)/(iii)/(iv).)*
- **B-452-1 — BREAKING (C-ABI 1.7): `fixpp_session_config_set_comp_ids`, `fixpp_session_config_set_begin_string` and `Session::open` refuse any byte `< 0x20` (SOH `\x01` included) or `'='` (0x3D) in CompIDs, BeginString and each configured `SupportedMsgTypes[].RefMsgType`.** The two C-ABI setters return `FIXPP_ERR_CAPI_CONFIG_INVALID` and leave any previously configured value untouched; `fixpp_session_config_set_comp_ids`'s refusal is atomic — a bad `target` does not leave a new `sender` stored. `Session::open()` applies the same byte floor to `sender_comp_id`, `target_comp_id`, `begin_string` and every configured `supported_msg_types[].msg_type` before any frame can be emitted, failing with `core::error::invalid_session_config`; a session configured with an offending value never opens and never emits a frame. The floor is one shared predicate — the existing credential-field floor, reused rather than widened. *(fixpp#452, 090-capi-refusals D-5/D-5b; `src/capi/config.cpp`, `src/session/session.cpp`, `include/fixpp/session/session_config.hpp`; witnesses `tests/capi/config_builders_test.cpp`, `tests/session/test_fixt_credentials.cpp`.)*

### Limitations

- **L-458-1 — a dict-backed parse can silently under-index a tag near `OffsetTable`'s DoS probe cap while still reporting a successful build.** `OffsetTable::build`'s `kMaxBuildProbe` arm (`src/wire/offset_table.cpp`, the `skip_insert = true; // DoS bound: leave this occ un-indexed` branch) can leave an occurrence un-indexed without assigning `status_`, so `find()` reports that tag absent from a table whose `build_status()` still reports success. **Out of scope for this feature's refusals**: because `status_` stays ok, `Parser::parse` succeeds and D-3's failed-re-parse fallback is never entered — this is a defect of a *successful* dict-backed parse. *(090-capi-refusals design §7, corrections-table C-7. Recorded, not fixed.)*
- **L-452-2 — RefMsgType(372) can carry an unvalidated `'='` at the two inbound-fed reject builders.** `build_reject` and `build_business_message_reject` emit `RefMsgType(372)` from a value sliced by `scan_frame_header`, which terminates a non-Data field at the next SOH and splits at only the **first** `'='` — so a surviving `'='` in an inbound MsgType(35) reaches the wire unrejected at these two sites, unlike the config-fed `build_logon` site, which D-5a brings into this feature's scope. What a **counterparty** parser does with a surviving `'='` is not measured. *(090-capi-refusals design §3.2/§7, corrections-table C-4. Recorded, not fixed.)*

## fixpp#495 / #493 / #486 — a shared reify table, copies that keep the source's caps, and an honest validator `noexcept` (C-ABI 1.8, BREAKING) (2026-09-23)

Authority: `.specify/495-493-486-dict-reify-copy.md` (§12). Each row names the tests that witness it.

### Behaviors

- **B-495-1 — on the shipped dispatch path, `dict::reify` and `fixpp_msg_clone` share the source's table by reference count; a live handle or clone keeps that table alive, never the `Dictionary` (C++ route).** Every view the `Session` hands an application callback (C++ and C) is parsed on `Parser`'s owned route, so a reify handle or clone of it, and a reify or clone of a handle's or clone's own view, holds one more reference to the same `table_view` instead of a deep copy. A session closed while handles live keeps its table alive until the last handle dies. On the C ABI only the sharing is claimed (why: the design note §3.4, owner ruling Q-6; the retained-shell cost is fixpp#501). *Witness: T-9 `ReifySharesOwnedTable.*`, T-10 `MessageWrite.CloneOfOwnedRouteViewSharesTheTable`, T-13 `ReifySharedDispatch.*` (C++: sharing + Dictionary expiry) and `Dict495CloneSharedTable.*` (C: sharing).*
- **B-495-2 (D-4) — a held view of a `dictionary_snapshot`'s table does not keep the snapshot or its `Dictionary` alive; the table itself lives as long as the view.** `shared_dictionary_view(snap)` returns the snapshot's table owner (`dictionary_snapshot::view_owner()`), not an aliasing pointer into the snapshot. *Witness: T-19(a) `DictionarySnapshot.SharedDictionaryViewSharesTheTableOwner`, T-11 `Dict495PinnedTableLifetime.*`.*
- **B-495-3 (D-5) — BREAKING (C-ABI 1.8): `fixpp_dict_load_from_xml` allocates from `std::pmr::new_delete_resource()`; a host's installed default resource no longer backs a C dictionary.** A host that installed a counting or limiting default resource sees no dictionary storage in it after the call returns. *Witness: T-20 `CapiDictionary.LoadDoesNotRetainInstalledDefaultResource`.*
- **B-495-4 (D-1c) — a `dict::reify` handle's impl is allocated from the `mr` passed to `reify`, so `mr` and the storage it handed out must stay valid until the handle is destroyed.** Destruction reads the impl from that storage and deallocates into `mr`: do not `release()` a monotonic `mr` while a handle minted from it is alive. Before fixpp#495 the impl came from the global heap and destruction only called `deallocate` on `mr`. *Witness: T-16 `ReifyErrorContract.ImplIsTheFactorysFirstMrAllocation` (the impl is `mr`'s first allocation), T-14 `ReifyOwnedAllocGuard.OwnedRouteZeroGlobalHeap`. The release-before-destroy hazard itself is not witnessed; it is stated in `include/fixpp/dict/reify.hpp`.*
- **B-493-1 — clone and reify re-parse under the source's `OffsetTable::Config`, so a copy keeps both raised and lowered caps, including a lazy group-read failure under a lowered group cap.** A raised-cap source now copies, including through the dict-free fallbacks (which returned an empty copy); a dict-free copy's root group context matches the parsed-source form; `FIXPP_ERR_WIRE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` from clone is reachable only from a source whose own build failed. *Witness: T-2 `ReifyEagerMaterialization.RaisedCapDictBackedSourceReifiesUnderItsOwnCaps`, T-3 `MessageWrite.CloneDictBackedRaisedCapSourceClonesUnderItsOwnCaps`, T-4 `MessageWrite.CloneDictFreeOversizedSourceStillReturnsOk` and `ReifyEagerMaterialization.RaisedCapDictFreeSourceReifiesReadable`, T-5 `*KeepsRaisedGroupInstanceCap` / `*KeepsLoweredGroupInstanceCap` (clone and reify), T-6 `MessageWrite.CloneOfUnbuiltOversizedSourceYieldsWireLimitExceeded`.*
- **B-486-1 — `dictionary_driven_validator`'s constructor is specified `noexcept(std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<table_view>)`: `noexcept` exactly where `table_view`'s move is nothrow, so on a toolchain whose move can throw (MSVC) the constructor does not promise `noexcept`.** The row claims the specification only. *Witness: T-1, the `static_assert` in `tests/wire/validator_domain_test.cpp`.*

### Limitations

- **L-495-1 — a source parsed through a borrowed `Parser{tv}` still deep-copies the table per handle, above NFR-003-3's ceiling and scoped out of it.** A C++ caller that parses its own frames with `Parser{tv}` and reifies or clones them pays one full `table_view` copy on the global heap per handle. The owned route that avoids it is `detail` (not public API). *Witness: T-12 `GroupMembershipSurvivesSourceDestruction`; the borrowed bench rows `BM_Reify_DictBacked_20tag` / `BM_Reify_DictBacked_Borrowed_20field`.*
