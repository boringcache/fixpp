## Toolchain

- **Compiler: Clang 22** (constitution Article II §2, Conan profiles in `conan/profiles/linux-clang-*`).
  - Local: install via your distro or `apt.llvm.org`'s `llvm.sh 22 all`.
  - CI provisions Clang 22 the same way, so local == CI.
- **Build: CMake ≥ 3.28 + Ninja.**
- **Deps: Conan 2.x.** Profiles live in `conan/profiles/`.
- **Python: 3.12+, SWIG >=4.2 (no upper bound), pytest** (only when working on Python
  bindings). The `<4.5` #296 safety cap was LIFTED — not because #296 was
  root-caused (it was not), but because the cap made it unfalsifiable: the crash
  needs SWIG 4.5.0, and while capped CI could only ever build 4.4.1. ⚠️ If the
  wheel lane segfaults during garbage collection with no `FAILED` line, that is
  #296 reproducing, not a flake — report it there rather than re-capping.

## Pre-PR build gate (mandatory)

Per constitution Article XVII §7, **every PR must come with a confirmed-green local build before it is opened.** No "open the PR to see what CI says" — CI verifies green local work, it does not replace it.

Minimum local cycle before opening a PR:

```bash
# 1. Conan install (linux-clang-debug at minimum)
conan install . -pr conan/profiles/linux-clang-debug --build=missing \
  -of build/linux-clang-debug

# 2. Configure + build + test
cmake --preset linux-clang-debug
cmake --build --preset linux-clang-debug
ctest --preset linux-clang-debug --output-on-failure

# 3. Python bindings (only if your change touches bindings/python/)
cmake --preset linux-clang-debug -DFIXPP_BUILD_PYTHON=ON \
  -B build/linux-clang-debug-py
cmake --build build/linux-clang-debug-py
PYTHONPATH=build/linux-clang-debug-py/lib pytest bindings/python/tests/ -v
```

Then add this line to the PR description:

```
local build: green on linux-clang-debug @ <git-sha>
```

PRs missing that line, or with a known-red local build, are rejected at review.

### AI agents: ask before running local builds

Local Conan + CMake + build + sanitizer cycles are resource-heavy (CPU, disk, time). When an AI agent (Claude, Codex) needs to run a local build on the user's machine, it **must surface an `AskUserQuestion` first** stating:

- which preset(s) it wants to build,
- approximate expected runtime,
- whether sanitizers will rebuild from scratch.

The agent does NOT auto-run `conan install` / `cmake --build` / `ctest` without explicit user approval. After the build completes, the agent reports the result (green/red, failures if any) and either proceeds to PR-open (green) or fixes the issue and re-asks (red).

## Quick setup (pre-commit hooks)

```bash
# 1. Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# 2. Install hooks (runs on every commit automatically)
pre-commit install

# 3. (optional) Run all hooks manually now
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## The line-number citation gate (issue #310)

`check-line-citations` blocks a commit that ADDS a line-number citation. There
are **eight spellings** and the gate knows all of them: <!-- citation-ok: worked examples, not real citations -->

| | shape | example |
|---|---|---|
| A | filename + line | `session.cpp:1258`, `reify_dispatch.hpp L15-24`, `session.cpp:~555` | <!-- citation-ok: worked example -->
| A | non-C++ target | `dictionaries/FIX44.xml:2805`, `CMakeLists.txt:401`, `tier1.yml:392` | <!-- citation-ok: worked example -->
| B | prose, no filename | `at line 2234`, `lines 138-140`, `~line 3232`, `line ~958` | <!-- citation-ok: worked example -->
| C | bare, parenthesised | `(:64)`, `(:316-328)` | <!-- citation-ok: worked example -->
| D | bracketed doc alias | `[2h §6.6]:1167-1204`, `` [2d §4.7]`:864 `` | <!-- citation-ok: worked example -->
| F | bare or backticked | `at :2953`, `` `:616` ``, `` `constitution.md`:335 `` | <!-- citation-ok: worked example -->
| F | tilde EITHER side | `` ~:1250 ``, `` :~1910 `` | <!-- citation-ok: worked example -->

**Seven of those eight were added on 2026-09-12, and NOT ONE was found by running
the detector.** Each surfaced because a person — or an agent reading like one —
met it in prose. That is the durable lesson: an instrument keyed on the shapes
you thought of reports clean about the shapes you did not.

The blind spots were not small. Form D reached **shipped public headers** —
`include/fixpp/core/error.hpp` carried 22, all pointing ~60 lines short of the
table they named. Form B's tilde was accepted only on the OUTSIDE — the <!-- citation-ok: worked example -->
spelling issue #310 quoted — so the inside form went unmatched for the life of
the gate — including in a shipped header. **That same asymmetry then recurred
in a different regex**: form F gated `` ~:1250 `` and not `` :~1910 ``, and the <!-- citation-ok: worked example -->
second spelling survived the whole sweep. When a pattern admits an optional
mark anywhere, write it on **both** sides and carry a self-test arm for each —
the cost is one `?`, and the omission is invisible to every instrument,
including the one you are editing. The extension list was C++ plus `md`,
which silently declared that only C++ and markdown rot, while 435 citations
pointed into the FIX dictionaries that dictionary features edit wholesale.

**If you are adding a ninth, do not guess it.** Derive the blind set by
complement: generate every line-number-ish token in the tree, subtract every line
the current deciders match, and read the residue. The procedure is written out
above `RE_A` in `tools/check_line_citations.py`. Guessing has failed eight times.

**Two spellings are measured and deliberately NOT gated**, recorded here so the
next person to notice one finds out it was seen rather than missed:
`build_replay_frame:1220` and `NotConnected:1839` — a symbol name with a line <!-- citation-ok: worked example -->
number and no extension. The tree's `identifier:NNN` hits are overwhelmingly
`collector:4318`, `sha256:…`, `localhost:8080`, `iterations:89261714`; a gate
that cries wolf gets narrowed by the next person, and **the narrowing is the
thing that rots**. Restricting to a CamelCase head does separate the classes
cleanly (7 live hits, zero false positives, measured 2026-09-12) — but seven
sites are cheaper to fix by hand than a ninth decider is to defend forever, and
a shape that is absent today is not absent tomorrow. They were fixed by hand.

A line number is a claim about a file that keeps moving. Nobody has to touch the
citing file for it to become false: the target drifts and the citation rots in
place, silently, because nothing ever re-runs a comment. The reader is sent to
the wrong line and usually lands on an unrelated comment, which reads as
plausible.

**Fix a flagged line by DELETING the number, not by correcting it.** Re-pointing
`session.cpp:1258` at `session.cpp:1265` re-arms the same defect with a fresh <!-- citation-ok: worked example, not a real citation -->
half-life. Cite a function/struct name plus a short quoted phrase instead — that
survives arbitrary line motion, and `grep` finds it if the quoted text changes:

```
before:  the residual ADD_FAILURE branch (pump_until_ready.hpp:225-232)  [worked example; citation-ok]
after:   drain_or_report's residual ADD_FAILURE ("#289: the io_context did not
         run out of work")
```

Citations into QuickFIX or vendored dependencies are exempt automatically — they
do not rot when this tree moves. For a deliberate in-tree exception, put a
`citation-ok` marker on the line; keep that rare.

The gate covers ADDED LINES ONLY. The pre-existing population on the LIVE
surfaces was swept in 2026-09-12's #310 pass; what remains is concentrated in
frozen `specs/<id>/` feature bundles, which are archival and are reported by the
gate rather than charged by it. To survey either:

```bash
python3 tools/check_line_citations.py --census          # candidates + out-of-range
python3 tools/check_line_citations.py --self-test       # prove the detector fires
```

⚠️ **Before believing any clean run, check that the instrument can report
non-zero.** `--self-test` carries an arm per form on a throwaway repo — including
a seeded out-of-range citation, a `:0`, a citation into an empty file, and both
spellings of form D — so a zero from `--census` is a measured zero rather than a
form the detector could not see. That distinction is the whole history of this
issue: the census once reported `0 out of range` while scoped to seven directory
trees that held almost none of this repo's line-cited documents.

The gate above catches citations you ADD. It cannot catch an edit that
INVALIDATES the ones already there — inserting a paragraph near the top of a
line-cited document re-points every citation below it, and adds none. Before
pushing a change that touches ANY `.md` — every changed one is checked, cited or
not, because the commonest citation form (`see the rule at line 18`) names no <!-- citation-ok: worked example, not a real citation -->
file and so can never be traced back to the document it means:

```bash
python3 tools/check_line_citations.py --shift-audit origin/main..HEAD
```

The fix for a finding is to reshape the EDIT, not to renumber the citations:
append narrative at the END of the file, and make every in-body edit an
in-place, same-line-count replacement.

## Slow / manual hooks

Some hooks are marked `stages: [manual]` because they are too slow for every
commit:

```bash
# Run clang-tidy on all C++ files (requires a configured build)
pre-commit run --hook-stage manual clang-tidy

# Run CMake configure sanity check
pre-commit run --hook-stage manual cmake-configure
```

## All available presets

`CMakePresets.json` ships these configure+build+test presets. Sanitizer/coverage presets rebuild from scratch (slow):

| Preset | Use |
|---|---|
| `linux-clang-debug` | Day-to-day dev; minimum for the pre-PR gate above. |
| `linux-clang-release` | Release build sanity. |
| `linux-clang-asan` | AddressSanitizer build (slow). |
| `linux-clang-ubsan` | UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer build (slow). |
| `linux-clang-tsan` | ThreadSanitizer build (slow). |
| `linux-clang-coverage` | llvm-cov instrumented build (slow). |
| `linux-gcc-release` | GCC sanity. |
| `windows-msvc-{debug,release,asan}` | Windows; runs in Tier 2 CI on demand. |

CI runs all of the above on every PR (Tier 1) except the Windows presets, which run only when the PR carries the `windows` label or via manual Actions dispatch.

## Codex review gates

Every non-trivial design change requires **Gate A** (pre-implementation);
every PR requires **Gate B** (post-implementation). See
`.specify/codex-review.md` for the invocation procedure.
