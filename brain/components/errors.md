# Error taxonomy

## Where to look

| You want | Go to |
|---|---|
| The C++ error set | `include/fixpp/core/error.hpp` |
| The C ABI error set | `include/fix/c_api/error.h` |
| How one maps onto the other | `src/capi/error.cpp` — `translate`, `translate_for_consumer` |
| Why the enum is shaped this way | `.specify/2k-log-otel.md` — ⚠️ **yes, the logging/OTel doc owns the engine-wide error enum.** Nobody guesses that; the header states it |
| Why the C surface differs | `.specify/2i-capi.md` |

## The four rules that do not rot

**1. One engine-wide enum, `uint8_t`, slot 0 reserved.** Not per-module error types. Every subsystem
contributes variants to the same set, in its own slot range, and the header comments name the owning
feature for each range.

**2. Numbering is additive — nothing is ever renumbered.** `[const §X.4]` forwards-compat. This is the
constraint that explains the layout: ranges look sparse and arbitrarily ordered because they were
appended in feature order, not designed as a block. **Do not tidy them.**

**3. The C ABI is deliberately NOT a C enum.** `fixpp_error_t` is a `typedef int32_t` with `#define`d
codes — the header says why in one line: *storage size is ABI-stable*. A C enum's underlying type is
implementation-defined, so it cannot be an ABI contract.

**4. The C set is deliberately COARSER than the C++ set, and `translate()` is lossy on purpose.** The
C++ enum is fine-grained for engine code; the ABI publishes banded, stable codes. Adding a C++ variant
does **not** oblige a new C code.

## ⭐ The decision worth knowing: errors are downgraded per consumer ABI minor

`translate_for_consumer(code, consumer_minor)` returns `FIXPP_ERR_UNKNOWN` when the code was introduced
in a **later** ABI minor than the consumer published.

The consumer's minor is carried on the engine handle, so the downgrade needs an engine to exist. **Two
exclusions are deliberate, and both are stated in the code at the call site** — the pre-engine MAJOR
gate is not routed through it (there is no handle yet to read a minor from), and success is not routed
through it (`OK` is `OK` at every version). Those two boundaries are the shape of the rule; find them
with `grep -rn translate_for_consumer src/capi/` and read the comments, not this paragraph.

## ⚠️ `FIXPP_ERR_CAPI_CONFIG_INVALID` was documented with a producer set the code never had

**Was wrong, and CORRECTED by 090 (fixpp#488).** `.specify/2i-capi.md` tied the code to the
construction-time thunks: §6.5's row said *"Used only by `guarded_call_construction`"*, the
`k_strerror_table` string named *"engine_create / dict_load / msg_create_outbound"*, and §5.2 said
*"CI grep enforces"* the thunk split. The shipped tree already returned it from explicit refusals at
entry points outside that whitelist, such as the session-config setters. Two passages restated the
rule: `.specify/api-contract.md` §7.5 (*"… for engine creation"*) and `.specify/2m-pybind.md`'s
*Construction failure modes*.

090 rewrote all three as a **condition**: the code comes from an entry point that cannot complete,
through either an explicit refusal or a caught exception on a fallible step. It is not
construction-only. The *"CI grep enforces"* clause was **deleted**, not reworded. fixpp#488 tracks
the closure. Before citing any of these passages, check that your copy carries the condition-stated
wording.

> **Do not re-derive a producer list for this code from a design doc.** Read the sites:
> `git grep -n FIXPP_ERR_CAPI_CONFIG_INVALID src/capi/`. A list goes stale with the next refusal.
> The code is the lesson: a documented producer set nobody re-checked went wrong without anyone
> noticing.

## A range that is frozen by the compiler, not by a comment

At least one sub-range is pinned with a `static_assert` on **both** endpoints, so inserting or
appending a variant that shifts either end fails the build.

⭐ **That is the pattern worth copying.** A comment saying *"this set is frozen"* is a claim nobody
re-checks; a `static_assert` is the same claim, checked on every build. **Re-derive which ranges are
frozen:** `grep -n static_assert include/fixpp/core/error.hpp`.

## What this page deliberately does NOT contain

No variant list, no counts, no slot numbers. They change with every feature that adds an error, and a
count reproduced here would be wrong within a release while still reading as authoritative.

**Re-derive the shape:**

```bash
grep -nE '^    // ── |^    // .* variants' include/fixpp/core/error.hpp   # ranges and their owners
grep -c '= [0-9]' include/fixpp/core/error.hpp                            # rough variant count
grep -n static_assert include/fixpp/core/error.hpp                        # what is frozen
```

- `expected_t<T>` is `std::expected<T, error>` — the return convention that keeps the hot paths free of
  exceptions. A function returning it is telling you it does not throw.

  same-named types with deliberately different member sets, for the same class of reason.
