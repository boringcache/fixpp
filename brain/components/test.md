## The seams are the design, not scaffolding

`[const §VII]` requires that everything touching the outside world be pluggable so the FSM and parser
can be tested without real I/O. That requirement is why these exist at all — they are not conveniences
added afterwards:

| Seam | Replaces | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `fixpp::core::Clock` | wall-clock time | heartbeat, `SendingTime`, reconnect schedules — a mock steps time deterministically instead of sleeping |
| `mock_transport` | a socket | drives the session FSM through a pre-recorded byte stream |
| `MessageStoreFactory` / `TransportFactory` | disk, network | see [`plugin-factory-ownership.md`](./plugin-factory-ownership.md) |

⭐ **Consequence worth holding on to:** if a new subsystem cannot be tested without real I/O, the
missing piece is a **seam in the design**, not a cleverer test. That is the same reasoning that put a
`Clock` interface in a FIX engine.

## ⭐ `mock_transport` is a PUBLIC header that refuses to compile in production

It lives under `include/`, not `tests/` — a deliberate choice, so external consumers can drive the FSM
in *their* tests. The safety comes from a build-system token: production targets do not define it, and
the header `#error`s without it.

> **The pattern is worth copying: gate by a token the build controls, not by directory placement.**
> "It's in `tests/` so it can't ship" is a convention; an `#error` is checked by the compiler. Same
> family as the `static_assert` idiom on [`quickfix-compat.md`](./quickfix-compat.md).

## Allocation discipline is enforced by an interceptor, not by review

`[const §VIII.5]` demands zero allocation between parse and `fromApp`. That is checked by
**`LD_PRELOAD`-ing a malloc interceptor** around dedicated guard binaries and failing if any
`malloc`/`free` is seen between markers.

⚠️ **Two things to know before trusting a green run.** The instrument is Linux-only by construction —
a passing Windows build proves nothing about allocation. And a guard test only covers the window its
markers enclose: *"zero allocations"* means *zero in that window*, never *anywhere*.

**Re-derive what is actually guarded** — the set changes, and a list here would rot:

```bash
ls tests/alloc_guard/ && sed -n '1,12p' tools/check_alloc.py
```

**Why the Windows markers are null function pointers (#417).** On POSIX the markers are weak
*undefined* symbols, so `if (alloc_guard_start) alloc_guard_start();` really can be null. On Windows
they used to be inline no-op functions, which made that same check test a function name that is never
null — harmless until `/WX` turned MSVC's C4551 into an error at every guarded call site. The fix went
into `tests/support/alloc_guard_markers.hpp` (null function pointers under `_WIN32`), not into the call
sites; rewriting every site was rejected because the null-checked call is the shape
`tools/check_alloc_guard_markers.py` exists to keep.

## ⭐ Bounded pumps (#289): the hazard is the unconditional `get()`, not the fixed window

Tests drive a manually-pumped `io_context`. The idiom
`ioc.run_for(W); ioc.restart(); fut.get()` **deadlocks** whenever the awaited op posts its completion
after `W` closes and nothing pumps again — reported by ctest as a timeout, and on a lane with no ctest
timeout configured, as a wedged job. `tests/support/pump_until_ready.hpp` holds the replacements.

**Why the window is PRESERVED rather than replaced by a self-driving pump.** Two reasons, both
measured and both still binding:

- `pump_until_ready` takes a **work guard**, so `run_for` cannot drain early and every call burns a
  slice. That is a documented per-call cost floor, and the migrated sites are microsecond-scale.
- The first transition to Active `co_spawn`s a **detached** `run_liveness_loop()`, and `co_spawn`
  POSTS its first resumption. An early-exit pump that stopped at future-readiness would leave that
  task unserviced; running the original window services it exactly as before.

So `run_window_then_ready` runs the caller's own window, then grants **one** boundary grace slice —
because `run_one_until` tests `now < abs_time` *before* dispatching, leaving a handler that became
ready at the instant the window closed merely QUEUED. The grace is not a CI tolerance and must not be
grown into one.

### The SECOND shape: `ioc.run()` with no window at all (#289 batch 17)

`run_window_then_ready` is not the whole story, and a reader who finds only it will reach for the
wrong primitive. A large class of sites had **no window**:

```cpp
auto fut = asio::co_spawn(ioc, s.open(), asio::use_future);
ioc.run();
auto val = fut.get();        // unconditional
```

`run()` returns when the context has **no work left**, which is not "the coroutine finished" — and
the live failure is not the exotic one. These tests reuse ONE `io_context` across several
`co_spawn`/`run` pairs and hand-write the `restart()` between them; **on a context still stopped from
the previous `run()`, `run()` returns immediately having dispatched nothing**, and the `get()` below
never returns. One deleted line.

`run_to_exhaustion_or_report(ioc, fut, "Site")` is the replacement. Three things about it differ from
`run_window_then_ready` and each is deliberate:

- **`ioc.run()` is preserved verbatim.** Bounding it is a *different* hazard (a context that always
  has work never returns), covered by ctest's per-test timeout (#337); a budget here would trade a
  wedge for a false RED on the slowest sanitiser leg.
- **It touches no context state on the success path** — no `restart()`. The migrated sites state that
  decision themselves, and a helper that restarted would take it over at every call site.
- **The miss branch is INSIDE the helper**, unlike every other #289 recipe, because at these sites it
  does not vary: no clock to cancel against, no window to have missed. The cost is that gtest reports
  the header's line; the report streams the site label instead.

⚠️ **A forced-miss arm proves the branch RUNS, not that it is REACHABLE.** The pairing that justifies
the class is `ci/red-arms/batch17-genuine-miss.sh`: base-shape-with-restart PASSES, base-shape-without
WEDGES, guarded-without REPORTS. Read all three; the third alone says nothing about the second.

⚠️ **The teardown shape is a property of the FIXTURE, not a style choice.** A drain is what RESUMES a
suspended frame, so draining in the wrong scope is worse than not draining:

| the `Session` is… | teardown |
|---|---|
| owned by the fixture | drain in the fixture destructor **body** |
| a block-local declared AFTER the fixture | drain on the **miss branch**, in the scope that still owns the storage — a destructor drain there is a measured `stack-use-after-scope` |

⚠️ **`ioc` must stay the FIRST fixture member.** Nothing holding a strand taken from the context may
outlive the context.

### The THIRD shape: a STAGING window before a mock-clock advance (#289 batch 18)

Neither of the two above. There is no `.get()` near it at all, so the census cannot see it; the
terminal half is usually already migrated and correct.

```cpp
auto close_fut = co_spawn(ioc, sess.close(graceful), use_future);
ioc.run_for(50ms);                    // <- STAGING window, blind
ioc.restart();
clock->advance(seconds{3});           // <- the discriminator
if (!run_window_then_ready(ioc, close_fut, 200ms)) { ... }   // terminal half, already migrated
```

The window's job is to get the coroutine to its **mock-clock sleep** before the test advances that
clock. If it has not parked when the window returns, the advance lands on a timer that is not yet
armed and is **LOST** — unrecoverable, not slow, because nothing advances the clock again and no
later pump rescues it. It surfaced as `session_tc_liveness` failing 1-of-369 on a starved
`linux-clang-asan` lane; fixed exemplar fixpp `4179da94`.

⚠️ **A LONGER `run_for` IS THE FIX EVERYONE REACHES FOR FIRST AND IT IS NOT A FIX** — it lowers the
probability and keeps the failure mode. The migration is an **observable staging condition**:
`pump_until(sess.state() == fsm_state::LogoutSent)`. `LogoutSent` is exactly "Logout emitted,
parked, not complete", so the window stays a *staging* window rather than becoming a *completion*
window — which is the objection that kept these sites blind.

⚠️ **#316 TOUCHED ONE OF THESE FUNCTIONS AND WROTE A COMMENT JUSTIFYING THE BLINDNESS.** Its premise
was right (*"the future must still be PENDING when this returns, so it is a staging window, not a
completion window"*) and its conclusion was wrong: the premise rules out a COMPLETION check, it does
not license a blind window. Batch 18 found the identical comment shape a second time, in
`cancellation_two_phase_test.cpp`. Both were **replaced**, not annotated.

⚠️ **A POST-HOC `EXPECT_EQ(state, LogoutSent)` IS NOT THE FIX EITHER**, and three sites had one. It
observes the right thing at the wrong time — it converts a lost advance into a confusing failure
instead of preventing it, and being non-fatal it lets the advance run anyway. Waiting on the same
predicate makes the same claim and removes the race.

**The instrument is `ci/mock-clock-staging-sweep.sh`**, which classifies each `advance()`/`step_to()`
by the nearest preceding pump inside its enclosing brace block. `poll()`/`run()` are NOT candidates —
they return on "no ready work", so starvation lengthens them, never shortens them; only a WALL-CLOCK
bound can return with the staging work still queued. Its verdict `NO-PUMP-IN-SCOPE` is an
**escalation**, not a clean bill: a fixture helper can stage while its caller advances, and no
same-function analysis finds that pair. **Quote the candidate count as "N that the sweep can see".**

⚠️ **THE FORCING SEAM IS THE WRONG INSTRUMENT FOR THIS SHAPE.** A forced MISS cannot catch a
spurious HIT — the hazard is a REAL `asio::steady_timer` completing the awaited future while the
mock-clock path never runs (PR #337: green in 2202 ms with all four forced-miss arms passing). The
arms that work inject the defect: delete the `clock->advance()` and assert RED, and force the staging
predicate to `true` and assert RED. `ci/red-arms/batch18-lost-advance.sh`.

⚠️ **AND THE OBVIOUS MECHANISM-LEVEL BARRIER WAS BUILT, MEASURED, AND REMOVED.** `mock_clock` already
computes the woken set in `advance()`, so exposing the parked-waiter count looks strictly better than
a lexical sweep — no lookahead, no same-function constraint, a positive observation. At both sites no
FSM state covers, it FAILED TO DISCRIMINATE, proven by running rather than by reading. `HbTrTest`'s cell passes with
its staging window starved to `run_for(0ms)`; `AdminDistinctNow`'s goes RED when starved but RED with
the barrier in place too, because what starving removed there was the TERMINAL collection window.

⚠️ **The mechanism first written for that disposition was WRONG, and the correction is the durable
half.** Not monotonicity — **how the sleep is ARMED**. `sleep_until` fires immediately when
`deadline <= steady`, so a late arm is rescued exactly when the deadline it names is already past: an
arm from a **stored anchor** (`last_inbound_steady_ + heartbt_int`) names a passed instant and is
RESCUED, while a **now-relative** arm (`steady_now() + logout_disconnect_timeout_ms`) names a NEW
future instant and is LOST. The condition on the first row: the anchor must PREDATE the advance —
inbound traffic refreshes it to `steady_now()`, after which that arm is now-relative in effect. That
rule decides candidate-vs-defect for the whole class, and it is why no clock-side fix reaches the
second row. It would have shipped as an assertion that cannot go RED for its own
class. Rebuild it only against a site where a mutation shows it load-bearing.

### The FOURTH shape: a `.get()` INSIDE the coroutine (#289 batch 19)

The three shapes above are all caller-side: the `.get()` runs on a thread that is *outside* the
io_context, and the whole #289 remedy is to give that thread a bounded way to wait. This one is
different in the only way that matters.

```cpp
auto fd = co_spawn(ex, drain(), use_future);   // spawned from inside a coroutine
co_await yield_n(8);                           // the window, counted in YIELDS
fd.get();                                      // <- runs ON the pumping thread
```

**The bounded outer driver does not bound this.** `fd.get()` executes inside the handler the driver
dispatched, so the block happens *within* `ioc.run_for(100ms)` / `ioc.run()`. The driver never gets
another turn: a 5 s deadline loop never re-tests its deadline, and `run_to_exhaustion_or_report` —
already the #289 guard for the outer future — is itself inside `run()`. The binary hangs and ctest
reports a timeout naming no site.

⚠️ **That is a measurement, not a reading of asio.** `ci/red-arms/batch19-coroutine-side-get.sh`
injects a defect no yielding can fix (the holder is never released, so the drain can never finalize)
and runs both shapes under it: the pre-batch shape **WEDGES** at the arm's budget, the guarded shape
**REPORTS** naming the site. Two arms, and they must not be collapsed.

⚠️ **THE WINDOW IS NOT THE MUTATION HERE, and reaching for it is the obvious mistake.** Starving the
yields is *recovered* by the guard's grace — correctly, that is what the grace is for — so it
produces a PASS, not a report. The injected defect has to be one no amount of yielding fixes.

The primitive is `yield_window_then_ready(fut, window, site, grace = kYieldGrace)` in
`tests/support/pump_until_ready.hpp` — the coroutine-side twin of `run_window_then_ready`, and it
**preserves the window** the same way: the `window` posts are issued unconditionally, so a site that
used `co_await yield_n(N)` for its own interleaving semantics keeps every one of those N yields.

⚠️ **IT REPORTS VIA `kWindowMiss`, AND THAT LITERAL WAS REWORDED TO BE UNIT-NEUTRAL RATHER THAN
DUPLICATED OR DISCLOSED.** The handover priced this item at "a fourth report literal, which is a
change to every driver that greps a `REPORT_TAIL`" — the thing batch 17 got wrong, shipping seven
correctly-driven sites as FLAG. The first draft accepted that price, reused `kWindowMiss` unchanged,
and shipped a **20-line comment explaining why the sentence was wrong** for the new caller ("run
window" and "one boundary grace slice" are durations; here they are yields). Both halves were
mistakes and the `/simplify` altitude pass caught them:

- **The cost estimate was never measured**, and no corrected size is written here either — a
  corrected estimate rots on the same schedule as the one it replaced. What is durable is **how to
  enumerate the dependants**, and every shortcut was tried and failed: not by the constant's NAME
  (a gtest-spi matcher binds the message, naming nothing); not by a driver's variable name
  (`git grep REPORT_TAIL` misses `pump-red-arm.sh`'s `TAIL=`); not by ONE fragment (drivers bind
  the tail, matchers bind the head); and **not with `git grep` at all**, because every #289 batch
  adds an *untracked* red-arm script carrying the tail, so a tracked-files-only search fails toward
  clean over exactly the files the batch is adding. The canonical recipe lives at `kWindowMiss`.
- **A knowingly-wrong sentence plus a disclosure is not a fix.** The literal now reads "its preserved
  **window**" and "the **bounded grace that follows**" — true of both primitives, at all ~540 sites.
  Both drivers re-proven against the new tail: seam arm 11/11 RED, `pump-red-arm.sh` RED as required.
- ⚠️ **AND THE REWORD BROKE A TEST MATCHER THE ENUMERATION COULD NOT SEE.** `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE`
  in `test_next_expected_msgseqnum.cpp` binds the literal's **head**; both probes used to size the
  change (`git grep REPORT_TAIL ci/`, and the literal's **tail**) were partial, and each was partial
  in a different way. **Enumerate a shared literal's dependants over the WHOLE tree, by a fragment
  the change does not touch** — and check `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE` / `ScopedFakeTestPartResultReporter`
  specifically, because a matcher bound to a message is invisible to every search keyed on the
  constant's NAME. The matcher was then proven load-bearing (old wording ⇒ RED), which is what makes
  the fix a fix rather than a second guess.

⚠️ **`yield_window_then_ready` IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT FROM `DRIVING_FREE_FUNCTIONS`** in
`tools/audit_co_spawn_named_closure.py`, and that is the one instrument where "teach it the new
spelling" was the wrong answer. It takes no `io_context&`, so that tool cannot resolve which context
it drove — which is the whole basis on which an entry there credits a caller. The exclusion errs
LOUD (a named closure driven only by it reads FLAG, never SAFE) and is pinned by a self-test arm.

⚠️ **`ci/mock-clock-staging-sweep.sh` NOW GATES THE ESCALATION BUCKET.** Every `NO-PUMP-IN-SCOPE`
row must carry a `KIND <letter>` in the comment block above it, drawn from the taxonomy table in the
sweep itself; a row without one exits 2. The first version of that control was per TREE — a set of
every letter used anywhere — and a hostile round falsified it in one line: delete ONE row's
disposition and every letter is still present somewhere, so it printed `ok`. **A control whose
population is the whole tree cannot see a single site lose its answer.**

⚠️ **`CALLER-ONLY × HELPER 9 → 1` IS A BUCKET, NOT THE CLASS.** `ci/pump-get-sweep.sh` classifies by
executor class × pump shape, and **neither axis captures "inside a coroutine"**. The eight sites
batch 19 took are the ones that happened to land in that bucket; the same shape can sit under POOL,
THREADED or THREAD-IN-FILE and the sweep would say nothing. It also under-counts *within* a file it
does classify: three live sites of this exact shape were `for (auto& f : futs) f.get();`, and a
range-for variable is not a receiver the sweep can trace back to a `co_spawn`. Do not read the
bucket going to 1 as the shape being done.

#### Batch 20 answered that with an AXIS, and the axis found two more sites

`ci/pump-get-sweep.sh` now carries a third axis — **call-site scope**, `CORO` or `CALLER-SIDE` —
alongside executor class and pump shape, plus tracking for the container shape. Together they moved
a batch of previously-invisible sites into the candidate list, among them the coroutine-side wedge
shape in `tests/sync/test_drain_immediate_destroy_after_reap.cpp` — a file batch 19 never opened,
whose own hang message already names `futs.get()` as a suspect. Those were migrated.

**Read the current numbers, do not read them here** — `bash ci/pump-get-sweep.sh --disposition`
prints the scope tally, and the counts move with every batch and with every change to the
instrument itself. What is durable is the CONDITION: `CORO` unguarded should be **0**, and
`ci/red-arms/batch20-coroutine-axis.sh` is what makes that zero mean something.

- ⚠️ **THE SCOPE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE RETURN TYPE, NOT A KEYWORD.** "The enclosing scope contains a
  `co_await`" is satisfied by a TEST body that merely *spawns* a coroutine lambda, so it marks the
  caller-side `.get()` **after that lambda's closing brace** as coroutine-side and reports nearly the
  whole corpus. A block introduced by a function or lambda returning `asio::awaitable<…>` cannot be
  entered from outside. The two controls that separate the readings put one `.get()` inside such a
  lambda and one immediately after it, and both die under a mutation of their own rule.
- ⚠️ **A ZERO FROM A NEW AXIS NEEDS A KNOWN-NON-ZERO CORPUS.** The synthetic controls prove the axis
  *can* say `CORO`; a wrong root or a broken traversal survives them.
  `ci/red-arms/batch20-coroutine-axis.sh` runs the **current** sweep against `tests/` at the
  pre-batch-19 commit — same instrument, older corpus — and requires **non-zero**, not a population.
  ⚠️ It deliberately does not assert a count: the first draft of its header said "the same eleven
  sites", the number batch 19 migrated, and the arm measures more than that, because batch 20's own
  container tracking makes further sites visible *in that same corpus*. A population figure there
  would have to be re-derived whenever the INSTRUMENT changes, not just the tree. Extract only the
  corpus: checking out the whole old tree would run the *old* sweep, which has no axis, and pass by
  construction.
- ⚠️ **Container coverage is ONE SPELLING, not the class.** `push_back|emplace_back(co_spawn(…))`
  consumed by `for (auto& e : c) e.get()` is what is tracked. An earlier draft of that disclosure
  listed the evasions it expected — an index loop, `futs[i].get()`, a moved-from container — and a
  check found **none of them** in the tree. The condition and the re-derivation recipe ship; the
  hypothetical enumeration does not.
- The sweep's controls now run in **tier 1** (`bash ci/pump-get-sweep.sh --disposition`). It still
  does not gate the candidate list — that list is not pinnable — but until this batch nothing ran
  its classifier controls at all, so a regression in them would have surfaced only as a number
  nobody could tell was wrong.

#### Batch 22 split a VALUE, not an axis — and that is where the residual was hiding

⚠️ **`EXHAUSTED` ANSWERED TWO QUESTIONS AND ONLY ONE HAD BEEN CHECKED.** It means *"a
run-to-exhaustion naming the spawn context appears above the get"*, which is satisfied by a
**caller-side** run (lexical "above" is the calling thread's program order ⇒ batch 21's work-guard
argument applies) and by a run written **inside a thread construct** (a drive on another thread ⇒
"above" is not program order at all, and the row is dismissed by the SELF-DRIVING argument instead).
The value now splits into `EXHAUSTED` / `EXHAUSTED-NOT-CALLER-SIDE`, and **all 35 `THREADED` rows are
the second kind** — read as dominated for four batches by an argument that did not apply to them. See
[`../failure-classes.md`](../failure-classes.md) class 12; the union is unchanged, so the batch
18-21 trend is still comparable.

⚠️ **THE DISCRIMINATOR HAD TO BE STRUCTURAL, AND A TOKEN TEST SURVIVED TWO HOSTILE ROUNDS BEFORE THAT
WAS NOTICED.** Asking *"does this statement name a thread type"* is not the same question as *"is the
run on the calling thread"*, and while it stood, two live rows were still being credited to the
caller-side argument. What ships tests **brace depth** — a caller-side run is a bare statement, and
every off-thread spelling puts its run inside a lambda body. It reddened five disclosed limits at
once, because "inside a lambda", "inside an unshared `if` arm" and "inside a nested block" are one
property; they are controls now, not limits. Both earlier rounds had been checking whether the LIST
OF SPELLINGS was complete, and the list was never the problem.

⚠️ **A POSITIVE DISMISSAL NEEDS A CLAUSE CHECK, AND `POOL` NOW HAS ONE.** The `SELF-DRIVE` axis
reports `RETIRED-BEFORE-SPAWN` / `STOPPED-BEFORE-GET` / `JOINED-BEFORE-GET` / `LIVE` over `POOL`
rows. ⚠️ **`LIVE` is its only CERTIFYING value, so disclose the side that COSTS** — the check matches
the pool's own name, so a retirement through a helper, a reference alias or a non-shadowing RAII
member reads `LIVE`. Cases `S-f`/`S-j` pin where it escalates too readily; `S-k` pins where it
escalates too little, which is the direction that matters. `join()` is deliberately its own value rather than folded into `LIVE`: it is the *opposite* of
a hazard, blocking until the queued work is done, so it dominates a get more strongly than any
lexical `run()`. The clauses are measured in
`tests/sync/test_co_spawn_work_guard_contract.cpp` arms 8-9, each carrying its own dismissal as the
control half in the same cell.

⚠️ **THE AXIS IS SCOPED TO `POOL` AND THE EXTENSION WAS MEASURED OUT, NOT OVERLOOKED.** Extending it
to `EXHAUSTED-NOT-CALLER-SIDE` rows needs no driver name — clause S1 holds structurally there (a run seen
only *since* the spawn was written by a thread constructed after it) and S2 becomes a `stop()` on the
spawn context. It is correct, and it escalated **34 of 36** rows, because these tests all retire the
context on a bail-out branch the get never reaches. Reverted; the measurement lives in the axis
header. The missing capability is **branch exclusivity** — the same wall batch 21's clause-2 probe
hit, now confirmed from a second direction.

⚠️ **AN ARM WHOSE FORCED DEFECT STAYS GREEN IS MEASURING ITS OWN SETUP.** A multi-driver arm was
written, passed, and was **deleted**: a driver mutated to return early did not redden it, because the
frame's parked window is microseconds, and widening it needs a timing band that file refuses. A note
where the arm would have been carries the reframing — `outstanding_work` is counted on the CONTEXT,
not per thread, so arms 1 and 5 already measure what every driver of it observes.

⚠️ **`t.expires_after(0s)` CANCELS the pending wait**, so a frame resumes by *throwing*
`operation_aborted`. Arms 1 and 5 never noticed, because they assert only that the future became
READY — which an exception satisfies. Any arm measuring something after the `co_await` must catch.

### ⚠️⚠️ A state assertion after a helper call is NOT a masking barrier

When designing forced-miss (RED) arms, the natural model is that a helper's miss-branch `return` will
be caught by the caller's next `ASSERT_EQ(sess.state(), …)`, aborting the test and masking every later
site on that path. **That model is wrong, and it is wrong in the direction that makes an arm look
masked when it is live.**

The miss branch calls `cancel_and_drain_or_report`, whose drain is generously budgeted. That drain
**completes the suspended coroutine** — which is its entire purpose — so the session reaches the state
the assertion is checking, the assertion PASSES, and execution continues into the sites the model
predicted were unreachable.

- **Trigger:** you are partitioning forced-miss arms and reasoning about which sites mask which.
- **Procedure:** treat the predicted firing count as **falsifiable**, run the arm, and count. What
  actually masks is an early `return` reaching a caller that cannot continue *for a reason the drain
  cannot repair* — not a state check the drain satisfies on its way past.
- ⚠️ Count on the **miss message's own distinctive tail**, not on the site label: the drain's residual
  report carries the same label, so a label-only count conflates the two.

This is the same family as [`message-store-quiescence.md`](./message-store-quiescence.md)'s warning
that a cleanup which completes a pending operation writes the state your verdict then reads.

**What remains to migrate is derived, never remembered** — the pin is an exact set, checked both
directions:

```bash
bash ci/pump-census.sh        # exit 0 iff the tree matches ci/expected-pump-sites.txt
bash ci/test-pump-census.sh   # the census's own assertions
```

⚠️ **The census has THREE blind spots and none is visible in the pin.** A site you deliberately
preserve de-censuses itself when a neighbour's migration shifts its `.get()` past the lookahead; a
site whose `.get()` was always beyond it was never *in* the pin and cannot leave it; and — the one
that widening cannot reach — **the window may not be lexically present at all**, because the pump is
indirected through a helper (`f.drain();` between the `co_spawn` and the `get()`). There is no
`ioc.run_for` to anchor on, so no lookahead width finds it.

**An empty pin would be a statement about the census, not about the tree.** The registry lives in
`ci/pump-census.sh`'s header — add to it, do not renumber it.

⭐ **The sweep that answers "does this file still have an unguarded `get()`?" must start from the
`get()`, not from the pump** — `ci/pump-get-sweep.sh`. A detector that recognises helper SHAPES can
only find the shapes its author thought of, and the cost of a miss is a wedged lane rather than a
failed assertion. Anchor on the thing every hazard must reach, and require the guard to NAME the
future it guards.

⚠️⚠️ **THAT SCRIPT'S OWN HISTORY IS THE WARNING: each fix for a false-clean introduced the NEXT
one.** Round 1 anchored on a single physical line, so a split declaration was invisible. The fix
spliced statements — and counted parens over raw text, so an unbalanced `(` inside a *string
literal* swallowed a whole test body, while a `continue` after the declaration skipped that region's
own `get()`. The fix for the foreign-guard mode narrowed it in RADIUS (a lookback window → the whole
file) rather than eliminating it, so guard state leaked across tests. **Three rounds, three
false-cleans, each created by the previous remedy** — the exact shape `failure-classes.md` class 2
names, arriving in an instrument rather than in prose. Every mode now ships as a control; add one the
day a new evasion is found, and do not trust a clean file as proof.

⚠️ **An undisclosed limitation is how this recurs — and a disclosure can be invisible rather than
absent.** That script's scope-limitation paragraph was once written with literal `\n` escapes
instead of newlines: a single 613-character line nothing would ever read, including through
`--help`. State limitations, and then *look at the rendered file*.

⚠️ **A pin row can sit in DEAD CODE.** The census is lexical and has no notion of reachability, so a
migrated site in an uncalled fixture helper drops a pin row while being unable to fire in any arm.
Read a non-firing RED arm as a question about reachability before assuming the arm is broken.

⭐ **A migrated site's miss branch is DEAD CODE under normal execution, so "the tests still pass" is
evidence about the HIT path only** — `ci/pump-red-arm.sh` forces each site's miss and requires
it to report. Two properties are load-bearing and neither is obvious:

- **One arm per rebuild.** PR #316 forced fifteen at once and covered **seven**: the first miss on a
  code path returns, and every later site on that path is never reached. Two sites in one helper, or
  one helper a driver calls twice, mask each other exactly this way. The rebuild cost per arm is the
  method, not overhead to optimise away.
- **An arm zeroes BOTH durations *and* forces the verdict, and neither alone is sufficient.**
  `((void)run_window_then_ready(ioc, fut, 0ms, 0ms), false)`. The wrapper is what works at a site
  whose future is ALREADY READY when its window opens; the zeroing is what stops the call
  dispatching, which is what leaves the awaited coroutine SUSPENDED so the miss branch's drain has
  a live SUSPENDED frame to resume **wherever one exists at entry** — which is where a
  miss-branch drain's LIFETIME obligation
  bites (#301/#313/#316), and is witnessed by `PumpWindowMiss.FeedMissDrainsWhileCaller-
  TemporaryAlive`, which zeroes both durations for exactly this reason. ⚠️ It does *not* help
  catch a wrong drain FLAVOUR — that needs a clock-bound frame, which a real window cannot
  complete either, so both forms see it equally. An earlier revision of this bullet said otherwise.
  **Do not restate the rule here beyond that sentence**; it lives at `run_window_then_ready`'s
  definition, and two superseded versions of it (*"zero the window"*, then *"zero both"*, then
  *"force the verdict, leave the durations"*) each survived in this bullet until someone read the
  header instead.

⚠️ **A TIMEOUT IS A DIFFERENT FINDING FROM A SILENT ARM, and collapsing them loses the interesting
one.** A forced miss HANGS rather than reports when the site's pump is INDIRECTED through a helper
(census blind spot (c)) — the call the arm forced is not the one the test waits on. The driver
reports that as `INCONCLUSIVE` and names it, which is the same question the dead-code note above asks: a
non-firing arm is a claim about REACHABILITY before it is a claim about the branch.

⚠️ **The driver is an instrument, so its REDs mean nothing until it is shown able to report non-RED.**
Seed a site that cannot report — delete one `ADD_FAILURE()` — and require the driver to call that arm
`SILENT`. N REDs from an unseeded driver prove only that it runs.

### The RUNTIME seam — `ci/pump-seam-arm.sh`, and why it does not retire the textual driver

`run_window_then_ready` takes an optional trailing site label. When it is passed,
`FIXPP_FORCE_WINDOW_MISS=<label>` makes exactly that site take its miss branch at RUNTIME, so a batch
costs one build and N runs instead of one rebuild per arm. That is what makes an ~80-site batch
verifiable at all; "one arm per rebuild" above remains the rule for the TEXTUAL driver, and the
masking reason behind it is unchanged — the seam does not fix masking, it makes forcing one site at a
time cheap enough to do everywhere.

⚠️ **It is a WEAKER witness, and the difference is not a detail.** Use the seam for breadth and
`ci/pump-red-arm.sh` to spot-check correctness; **keep both**. ⚠️ **The precise difference is stated
at `run_window_then_ready` in `tests/support/pump_until_ready.hpp` and is deliberately NOT copied
here.** It has been wrong in both directions already — once overstating the seam, once understating
it — and a third copy is a third thing to keep true and the one nobody updates.

⚠️ **THE SEAM'S SILENCE HAS TWO CAUSES AND ONE FAILS TOWARD CLEAN.** No report can mean the miss
branch did not report, or that the label matched nothing at all — a typo, a site that passes no
label, or a site the run never reached. Identical empty output, opposite meanings. So the primitive
ANNOUNCES on stderr *before it pumps*, and the driver requires that line: no announcement
is `NO-SUCH-SITE`, never a pass. The driver carries a negative-control arm forcing a label no site
carries, to prove that verdict is reachable.

⚠️ **The seam forces only sites that PASS a label, which is a strict subset of the migrated sites.**
Everything migrated before the seam existed passes none and is reachable only through textual
mutation. Derive which sites are forceable — `ci/red-arms/batch11-labels.txt` is one batch's list,
not the population.

⚠️ **Locate a label with `strings` on the BINARY, never a source grep.** A stale binary is this
procedure's only silent failure mode and it fails toward clean: the source says the label exists
while the binary that actually runs contains no such string.

## ⚠️ The catalogue's `test` rows are not a coverage measure

Every `test` row reads `backlog`, and — as with `nfr` — **that is not evidence the work is absent**;
see [`nfr-and-tooling.md`](./nfr-and-tooling.md) for the condition and the derivation recipe. The test
tree is large and the CI tiers are real. **Do not read this family's status column as coverage.**

## The pump seam (#289) — one primitive, and the copies a census cannot see

`tests/support/pump_until_ready.hpp` is the hoisted primitive six sibling helpers were meant to
collapse onto. Two things a reader needs that the code does not state:

- **`test_fifo_across_cycles.cpp`'s local `pump_until` is a DELIBERATE non-adopter, not a straggler.**
  The shared seam is parameterised on a budget and a slice — both wall-clock — so its unit of progress
  is TIME. That cell's is HANDLERS (`poll_one()`, one at a time), which is what makes its interleaving
  reproducible. An iteration cap is not expressible as a duration. It becomes a genuine adopter only
  if `pump_until` ever gains a handler-count bound.
- **`InteropEngineFixture::run_until` is an ADAPTER, not a seventh spelling.** It delegates; the only
  thing it adds is reviving a context stopped at entry, which the shared primitive deliberately will
  not do. Read the disposition at the definition before treating it as un-migrated — its scope has
  been over-estimated twice, both times from the helper's NAME rather than its body.

⚠️ **The census that tracks this migration keys on DEFINITION SITES, so it cannot see a copy**
(failure class 13). One survived that way: `first_frame_stop_test.cpp` held a copy of the helper
`engine_firstframe_test.cpp` had already retired, and its comment cited that file for two things the
file no longer contains. If you are about to conclude a seam helper is retired, enumerate by shape.

## The temp-dir seam (#404) — and the measurement that could not see half the leak

`tests/support/temp_dir.hpp` is the second hoisted primitive on this page. It was extracted out of
`tests/session/_fixtures_/store_temp_dir.hpp` when `tests/log` needed it too — a `tests/log` file
including a fixture out of `tests/session` is a layering inversion. That old path is now a
**migration shim with a stated end condition and a re-derivation recipe**; read its banner before
adding an include to it.

Three things the code cannot tell you:

- **The two removal functions are not interchangeable, and the choice is a correctness one.**
  `try_remove_temp_dir` is `noexcept`; `remove_temp_dir` ends in a throwing attempt so a genuine
  holder surfaces instead of leaking. Destructors are implicitly `noexcept`, so calling the throwing
  one from an RAII `Cleanup` guard turns a leaked directory into `std::terminate()`. Several
  `tests/config` guards are exactly that shape.
- **⚠️ The Windows retry loop is inside `#ifdef _WIN32`, so NO Linux build compiles it.** A green
  Linux matrix is not evidence about that block — an arithmetic error in its backoff survived a full
  local sweep and was caught by reading, twice, independently. If you change it, the instrument is
  MSVC or nothing.
- **⚠️ The retry is not what fixes the leak at most sites.** Where an owner still holds the sink
  (the `tests/config` sites, which reset a `shared_ptr<Logger>` first) the RESET is the fix and the
  retry is only insurance — retrying cannot outlast a handle held for the rest of the test. Which
  mechanism is load-bearing is a property of the CALL SITE, not of the helper.

⚠️ **The measurement that opened #404 was ~5/6 wrong, and the instrument is why** (failure class:
an instrument that fails toward clean). It counted leftover directories under `%TEMP%`, so it read
the whole population as "Windows removals that failed". Five of the six had **no end-of-test cleanup
at all** — they leak on Linux too — and a second class leaked into the **source tree** under
`FIXPP_CONFIG_FIXTURE_DIR`, which a `%TEMP%` census cannot see by construction. Before believing a
temp-dir count, enumerate the directories a fixture can create, not the ones one directory holds.

## The fuzz replay set (#408) — being BUILT is not being RUN

`tests/fuzz/CMakeLists.txt` registers one `fuzz_replay_<name>` ctest per **corpus
directory**, not per harness. A harness with no `corpus/<name>/` therefore registers nothing — and it
is still compiled, because `FIXPP_BUILD_FUZZ=ON` on `linux-clang-asan` builds every target in the
directory. It then reports green forever without executing a single input. Nothing is missing,
nothing errors, no job goes red: the loop simply has nothing to find.

⚠️ **This is not a hypothetical.** #405 was a genuine hang in `fuzz_message_store`, and it survived
because CI had never executed that harness. #213 closed the neighbouring gap — seeds that existed
but were replayed by nothing — and its title reads as though it covers this one, which is how PR
#407's first draft came to defer the work to a closed issue.

**The invariant is "a replay exists", not "a corpus directory exists".** The first draft of the guard
tested `IS_DIRECTORY corpus/<name>/`, which is a *proxy* — and one that is true for only one of the
two fuzz suites, since `tests/config/fuzz/` names its inputs `crashes/` and registers
`fuzz_replay_toml_crashes` against `fuzz_toml_loader`. `fixpp_add_fuzz_replay()` now records what it
registered, and `fixpp_assert_every_fuzz_harness_replays()` reads that record, so the same check
serves both suites and survives either renaming its inputs. Widening a directory-shaped check across
both trees instead **miscounts while looking authoritative** — the error #408 records.

⚠️ **The check must be called DEFERRED** (`cmake_language(DEFER CALL ...)`). `BUILDSYSTEM_TARGETS`
reports only the targets defined *so far*, and appending an `add_executable` to the end of a
CMakeLists is the most natural way to add a harness. Called inline the check is silently GREEN for
anything declared below it — proved by a forced arm against the inline draft, not reasoned about.

⚠️ **Enumerate from the buildsystem, never from a second hand-written list.** A list of harness names
maintained beside the `add_executable` calls is derived from the same source it is meant to check, so
it cannot disagree with them: a tautology that reports PASS because it cannot report anything else.

**On the exemption list:** it escalates nothing on the tree as shipped, because every harness is
either replayed or named in it with a reason. That is the property to preserve — a check that
escalates most of its population conveys as little as one that escalates none. It is checked in both
directions, so a name that no longer names a harness, or one that has since gained a replay, is
fatal rather than a stale claim reading as a live decision.

⚠️ **A `fuzz_replay_*` grades on EXIT CODE under `-runs=0`, and the harnesses do not all fail the
same way.** Some trap on their own invariant (`fuzz_decimal_parse`'s `__builtin_trap`,
`fuzz_session_cancellation`'s `std::abort`), some rethrow to `terminate` (the XML loaders), and some
tolerate every typed error and so grade **only** on a sanitizer finding (`fuzz_file_cert_source`,
`fuzz_transport_read_path`, `fuzz_wire_nested_slice`). A logic-error mutant leaves that last group
green. Also note `-runs=0` executes libFuzzer's implicit **empty** input, so a RED arm that fires on
any input proves the binary ran, *not* that your seeds were delivered — gate the mutant on
`size > 0` if that is the claim you need.

## The committed interop evidence (089) — a digest-bound artifact, and the two ways it read green

`tests/interop/witness_evidence.yaml` is a **committed** artifact: a matrix run promotes its
comparison results into the tree, and `tests/interop/cell_results_schema_check_test.py` gates them
on every build thereafter. That shape — evidence at rest, re-checked by a schema suite — is worth
understanding before changing anything under `tests/interop/`, because Gate B found **four rounds**
of defects in it and **not one** in the code it was built to verify.

⭐ **Both headline failures were the same class: the gate could not report failure.** Flipping every
committed witness to `verdict: fail` left the suite green, because nothing read `verdict`; forging
every `run_id` to a nonexistent value left it green, because nothing joined the witness rows back to
the run ledger. Neither is visible by reading the suite — each was found by mutating the artifact and
watching the suite stay green. **Before believing this suite's green, mutate one row and watch it
redden.** The suite now has arms for both, plus population arms; the procedure is the durable part,
not the arm list.

⚠️ **A census-derived expected count cannot disagree with the census.** The population check first
compared "witnesses present" against "witnesses the census implies", both computed from the same
committed file — so dropping a whole business step reduced *both* sides and stayed green, and
dropping a whole config did too. What closed it is an **independent pin** (`CENSUS_KEY_COUNT` ×
`CONFIGS` ⇒ `WITNESS_ROW_COUNT` in the suite) that the artifact cannot move. Same shape as the
fuzz-harness rule above: enumerate from something the subject does not write.

⚠️ **The uniqueness key is `(witness_id, config)`, not `witness_id`.** Each census key produces one
witness per sanitizer config, so a `witness_id`-only uniqueness assertion rejects a correct artifact.
Re-derive from `_full_keys` rather than assuming either shape.

⭐ **A digest-bound file cannot be edited — not even its comments — and that collides with the
citation gate.** `conversation_script.yaml` and `probe_script.yaml` are hashed by the cell drivers at
run time and the hash is recorded into the evidence (`SCRIPT_BY_RUN_KIND`,
`_check_script_digest_binding`). So a **comment-only** edit changes the SHA-256 and invalidates every
committed run that attests the old bytes. 089 hit the deadlock head-on: the citation gate wanted two
comment lines rewritten, the digest gate forbade touching the file at all, and the `citation-ok`
escape is itself an inline marker that changes bytes. **The only move that satisfies both is
regenerating the matrix after the edit** — which is cheap when the build trees are warm, and is the
answer to give rather than reaching for a waiver. Budget for it whenever a cleanup pass sweeps
`tests/interop/`.

⛔ **`occurrence: 0` is a legitimate value, so a parser must not infer presence from it.** The
comparator's fail-closed rewrite uses explicit per-field `has_*` seen flags set only after a
successful parse; the majority of committed witnesses carry `occurrence: 0`, so a zero-means-absent
reading silently accepts records that never declared the field.

⛔ **What the evidence does NOT attest: the fixpp revision that produced it.** The ledger binds the
script digest (verified against the live file every run) and records the counterparty flavour,
version and digest (joined internally, verified against no external truth). It records **no fixpp
source or binary digest at all**, so an edit to the comparator, the readback writer or
`build_replay_frame` leaves the committed artifact green while describing a tree that no longer
exists. That is `L-089-1` in `spec/behaviors-and-limitations.md`, deferred to fixpp#431 — do not
read a green schema suite as evidence the current tree still passes interop.

## A live-cell driver cannot see the counterparty's Reject (#442) — the harness reads the peer's transcript

A session-level `Reject(35=3)` from the counterparty leaves every in-process witness a live-cell driver
has untouched: fixpp stays Active, its outbound seqnum has already advanced, and the peer does not log
out. The APDS cell passed its gtest while QuickFIX-J rejected the very order the cell exists to show
accepted. So the verdict lives in the parent harness: `_finalize` in
`phase-9-harness/tools/run_interop_cell.py` fails a passing cell whose counterparty transcript holds an
`OUT` 35=3/35=j frame the cell did not declare. Declared means the conversation script's peer Reject
messages for that combo, matched on 35 plus their literal intent fields, each at most once; a cell with
no script declares none.

- **Rejected: a per-driver witness** (an `Application::fromAdmin` recorder in each driver). One copy per
  driver, and it still needs the live harness to run at all.
- **Rejected: a per-cell allow-list of RefMsgType(372).** It restated the script in four places and
  admitted any number of TestRequest Rejects for any reason.
- ⚠️ **A parent golden is not a substitute.** It notices a peer Reject only as unexplained drift, and a
  cell with `parent_golden=False` has no golden at all.
- **The in-repo golden gate used to compare against the PREVIOUS run's capture sidecar** (the harness
  wrote it after the gtest had already read it). Superseded by #445: the gtests no longer read it, and
  the harness's `_finalize` checks each cell's OWN transcript with `interop_golden_check --check <mode>`.
  **Rejected for #445:** porting the diff to Python (a second copy of `parse_golden`/`diff_transcripts`
  and both exclusion profiles) and a second golden-only gtest invocation (a mode switch in every
  golden-gated test).

## Discarded `[[nodiscard]]` results in tests (#417) — Linux green is not MSVC green

When `FIXPP_WERROR` was wired, MSVC reported far more discarded `[[nodiscard]]` results in `tests/` than
any Linux build ever had. The cause is the standard library, not the tests: MSVC's STL declares
`std::expected` (so `fixpp::core::expected_t`) and `std::future` `[[nodiscard]]`, libstdc++ does not,
and clang also stays silent on a discarded `co_await` result. **A clean clang/libstdc++ build says
nothing about this class; only a Windows `/WX` build is an instrument for it.**

**The rule the sweep applied, site by site** — reuse it rather than re-deciding:

- The test depends on the call succeeding (an `open`, a `drain`, a setup `store` a later assertion
  assumes) → assert it. `ASSERT_*` cannot compile in a coroutine, a lambda or a non-void helper; use
  `EXPECT_*` there, and a bool-returning helper propagates the failure like its sibling checks do.
- The result is irrelevant or checked another way (a deliberately invalid frame judged by state or
  emitted frames afterwards, teardown, a future completed by a later `ioc.run()`) → `(void)` **with the
  reason next to it**. The cast is the standard's own opt-out; it is only as good as that reason.
- **Never add an assertion inside an `alloc_guard_start()`/`alloc_guard_end()` window** — the window is
  measuring allocations, and an assertion is not free.

**Rejected:** disabling C4834 on MSVC test targets (hides real discards and fakes no decision), and a
mechanical `(void)` at every site (adds casts that read as decisions nobody made). The audit left two
test-strength questions open rather than strengthening tests silently — setup stores nothing asserts,
and a loop that passes vacuously on an empty capture — tracked in fixpp#436.
