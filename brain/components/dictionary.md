## What is actually here

A real subsystem, not a thin layer: **two independent loaders** — `xml_loader.cpp` (QuickFIX-style FIX
XML) and `orchestra_loader.cpp` (FIX Orchestra) — plus `reify.cpp`, `field_traits.cpp`,
`version_registry.cpp`, `version_profile.cpp`, `dictionary_snapshot.cpp` and a
`reify_dispatch_bridge`. **Two owning design docs**: `2c-codegen.md` (header layout, multi-version
coexistence, dialect overlay binding) and `215-dictionary-view.md`. ⚠️ 215's alias design — §3's
`shared_dictionary_view` forming an aliasing pointer, §5b's "third owner of the snapshot's control
block", §6 seam 7's G2 count of one — is **superseded in part** by
`.specify/495-493-486-dict-reify-copy.md` §6 (D-4): the snapshot owns its table in the table's own
control block and G2 asserts zero matches. The passkey and the provenance check stand.

⚠️ **Counts and file lists rot.** Derive the current surface from the graph index; the point above is
the *shape* — two loader front-ends converging on one dictionary representation, with codegen on top.

## ⚠️ The catalogue under-reports this family — a LEAD, not a verdict

`spec/feature-catalogue.md` defines `Status ∈ {backlog, planning, implementing, done, dropped}`, where
**`backlog` means not started**. Several `dictionary` rows sit at `backlog` while the tree plainly
contains the thing:

| Row | Says | Observed 2026-08-29 |
|---|---|---|
| **D-007** — XML data dictionary format loader | `backlog` | `src/dictionary/xml_loader.cpp` exists and is **over a thousand lines** |
| **D-003** — FIX 5.0SP2 + FIXT.1.1 dictionaries | `backlog` | ⚠️ **not concluded.** Generated headers are produced at **CMake configure time**, so their absence from `include/` proves nothing either way |
| **D-008** — code-generated constexpr field metadata | `backlog` | ⚠️ **not concluded, and plausibly accurate** — a search for constexpr field-metadata surfaces found nothing. Codegen shipping does **not** imply this specific mechanism did |

> ⭐ **Only D-007 is stated as a discrepancy.** The other two are the interesting part of this table:
> they *look* stale and are **not established as stale**, because the obvious probe is blind to
> configure-time generation. **A row that looks wrong is not a row that is wrong** — and a page that
> flattened all three into "the catalogue is stale" would be manufacturing exactly the false claim this
> bundle exists to prevent.

> **Adjudicated 2026-08-31 (user), for the COLUMN not for these rows.** The same question was open
> on `nfr` and is now closed: a `backlog` cell in this catalogue can be **merely unflipped**, not
> unbuilt. See [`nfr-and-tooling.md`](nfr-and-tooling.md) for the reasoning and the derivation recipe.
> An out-of-repo planning tracker additionally names **D-001, D-003 and D-008** in its
> *delivered-practice-never-flipped* set. ⚠️ **That is a lead and nothing more.** It is planning
> material, not a source of truth, and this page's own probe for D-003/D-008 was *blind* rather than
> negative — so the two rows above stay **not concluded**. Resolve them by reading the configure-time
> codegen output, not by believing either document.

**This needs per-row adjudication against source, not a bulk verdict.** See the sibling note on `nfr`
in [`nfr-and-tooling`](./nfr-and-tooling.md), where the same status column is unreliable for a
different and possibly legitimate reason.

## Group context keys — one walk, one clamp, and three rejected alternatives

A repeating-group *context* is keyed by `(msg_type, ancestor count-tag chain OUTERMOST-FIRST, no_tag)`
and clamped to `kMaxGroupContextDepth`. Several places reconstruct that chain. The decisions below are
the **why**; verify any behavioural statement against source before citing it.

**DECIDED — one walk, one clamp, in that order.** `detail::group_parent_path` walks and reverses but
does NOT clamp; the clamp lives only in `make_group_ctx_delim` / `make_group_ctx_key`, which keep the
first — i.e. OUTERMOST — K entries.

**REJECTED — clamping inside the walk.** Stopping the walk at K keeps the INNERMOST K, which is a
*different key for the same context* once the chain is longer than K. That was issue #264: the FR-023
completeness probe clamped during its walk while the loaders' capture path and `as_table_view()`
clamped after theirs, so a COMPLETE dictionary was refused at load by a message asserting an internal
invariant violation — sending readers to look for a bug in `as_table_view()` rather than in the probe.
⚠️ The tempting variant *"bound the walk at K+1 since the clamp discards the rest anyway"* is the same
defect in new clothing; the walk must stay unbounded.

**REJECTED — truncating the chain at a repeated tag when the relation has a cycle.** This looks
fail-closed and is not: a truncated array is a **well-formed key**, so instead of missing every record
it can COLLIDE with one. A self-parented group truncates to `[G]`, which is exactly the key of that
group's own inner occurrence, so the probe *matches* and reports the dictionary complete. A cycle now
yields no path at all, and both callers treat that as a violation.

> ⚠️ **The parent relation is NOT guaranteed acyclic, and the reason is easy to miss.** Both loaders
> reduce a message's field run to one `FieldRef` per tag using an **unstable** sort, so which of two
> equal-tag occurrences survives is *unspecified* — and when the inner occurrence of a self-nested
> group wins, the relation holds `immediate_parent[G] == G`. Do not re-derive how often that happens;
> the answer is a property of the standard library's sort, not of this code.

**REJECTED — refusing any chain longer than K.** Measured, not argued: a *lone* context past the clamp
loads and resolves correctly end-to-end, because `wire::group_context::pushed` saturates by dropping
the push at K — keeping the OUTERMOST K, the same end `make_group_ctx_key` keeps — and every production
query derives its span from a `group_context`. Store key and wire query key therefore coincide past the
clamp. Depth alone is not the defect, so a depth rule would refuse input that demonstrably works.

**DECIDED — refuse only a measured COLLISION.** Past K the clamp is lossy, so two genuinely different
contexts can produce byte-identical keys, and `group_ctx_key::parent_path` is a fixed K-element array
that cannot hold them apart. The key-dedup in the shared `flush_group_ctx_delims` would keep the first
and silently DROP the second, leaving the survivor to answer for both — a message nested under the
dropped parent resolving the *wrong delimiter*. Each record now carries its unclamped chain beside the
clamped key, so the flush can tell "same key, same chain" (a benign duplicate — a group declared in
both header and body) from "same key, different chain" (unrepresentable, refused). Loader-local: the
store, `group_ctx_key` and every query path are untouched.

⚠️ **This check REJECTS a dictionary, so its false-positive arm is the load-bearing one.** A test that
only proves it fires cannot catch it firing when it should not — and a spurious hit here is a hard
rejection of valid input, which is the defect #264 was filed about. Both arms are witnessed, and both
loaders are, because the refusal is shared but each raises its own exception type (FR-006c).

> ⭐ **This is failure class 7 in [`failure-classes.md`](../failure-classes.md), and #264 is its
> reference instance.** The spurious rejection was *the only thing* keeping chains past the clamp out
> of a store that cannot represent them. Fixing the false rejection — correctly — is what exposed the
> silent merge behind it. The fix and the newly-reachable defect were found in the same review round,
> by two independent reviewers, neither of which was looking for the second one.

**The query side does NOT clamp, and that is now ASSERTED rather than left as a lead.**
`group_ctx_query` / `group_ctx_equal` compare the caller's span verbatim — a four-iterator
`std::equal`, so any length difference is a MISS, not a truncation. An over-long path therefore
matches *nothing* and reads to the caller as "context not declared": a fall-through to the bare global
store for `group_first_field`, a `nullopt` for `group_first_field_exact`.

No production caller can reach it. Every context lookup builds its span as
`{ctx.parent_path.data(), ctx.depth}` from a `wire::group_context`, whose `parent_path` is a fixed
`kMaxGroupContextDepth` array and whose `pushed()` DROPS the push at capacity. The residual hazard is a
TYPE one: "clamped key" and "raw ancestor chain" are both `std::span<std::uint16_t const>`, so nothing
at a call site distinguishes them — and the dict layer now has an unclamped chain builder
(`detail::group_parent_path`) one step away.

The precondition is stated ONCE, in `make_ctx_query`, which all four context accessors go through. It
is `assert`-based deliberately: those accessors are `noexcept` and sit on the validator's per-group
path, so it must cost nothing in release. That means the guard exists only where `NDEBUG` is undefined
— it converts a silent wrong answer into a loud one under test and debug builds, and changes nothing
in release. ⚠️ A release build therefore proves nothing about it; the witness
(`TableViewCtxQuery.OverLongAncestorPathTripsTheClampAssertion`) is compiled and COUNTED under
`NDEBUG` via `GTEST_SKIP` rather than `#ifdef`'d away, so the release leg reports a skip instead of the
test silently vanishing from the suite.

**Making the wrong key unrepresentable — a `group_ctx_path` type producible only by clamping — was
considered and NOT done.** It would change key types in an installed public header and touch every
consumer, which is a different change from the one that fixed #264. The assertion is the proportionate
guard for a footgun that is real but currently unreachable.

## Length+Data pairs from Orchestra `lengthId` (#427)

The Orchestra loader reads `lengthId`, so `Dictionary::length_pair_data_tag` answers for
FIX Latest (B-427-1). The standard pair table (`include/fixpp/core/length_data_pairs.hpp`)
is drift-tested against the union of all ten dictionaries. A dictionary's own pair matters
only when neither of its tags is standard (B-426-3).

⚠️ **The table lives in `core`, not `wire`.** `table_view` must classify a tag, and the
dictionary layer may not include wire ([arch §2.3]); `include/fixpp/wire/length_data_pairs.hpp`
survives as a re-export of the same names, so a reader who follows an older pointer lands on
using-declarations rather than the table. ⚠️ `tools/check_layers.py` walks `src/` and
`bindings/` only, so a dictionary **header** including a wire header passes it **silently** —
the move was made for correctness, not because a gate demanded it.

`table_view` carries one `bool` — some registered pair has **both** tags outside the standard
table — because `wire::dict_hooks::for_table_view` installs the pair callback **only** when it
is set, and that bundle is built per message. What was rejected: a sixth `dict_hooks` pointer to
an inline 8 KiB bitset (contradicted design §3's five fields and `table_view`'s own
footprint-sized structure), and computing the predicate inside `for_table_view` (it is on
per-message paths). `set_length_pair_data_tag` is strongly exception-safe at **O(1)** — an
earlier transactional version copied both maps per registered pair and made
`Dictionary::as_table_view()` quadratic (+26.3 % on FIX42); do not reintroduce it. Zero is
refused on **both** halves, at the setter *and* at pair formation in both loaders, because zero
is the "no pair" answer of every accessor.

⚠️ **fixpp#457 then moved the refusal UPSTREAM of all three, and that changed which of them a
test can still reach** — the kind of thing a page like this exists to record, because the guards
are still in the source and read as live. A field numbered 0 is now refused at DECLARATION in
both loaders, upstream of both guards.

**Do not read either guard as a witnessed path, and do not take a reachability verdict from this
page** — derive it, because the two halves differ and the difference follows from where each value
comes from: a `data_tag` is a key of the loader's own field store, which the declaration rule bars
from zero; a `length_tag` comes from a `lengthId=` reference, parsed with the shared
`parse_orchestra_id` (which must keep admitting zero for the structural-id namespace) and resolved
*after* the declaration check. The recipe: read `parse_document` / `collect_fields` call order and
ask, for each argument, whether it originates in a declaration or in a reference. The guards are
kept as boundary conditions — zero is the "no pair" answer of the accessors, which is a property of
the accessors rather than of today's callers.

⚠️ **This closes a disposition `specs/002-dictionary-xml-loader` deferred for itself.** That spec's
§10 **follow-up F4** and its `CHK017` checklist row both list `<field number="0">` as an XML-grammar
edge case left undecided in v1.0 ("rejected vs accepted" unstated). The bundle is frozen, so it
still reads as open; the answer is REJECTED, here and in `B-457-1`. Pointer lives here because a
frozen bundle cannot carry it. The decision that keeps the
rule off the shared parser is the load-bearing one: `<fixr:component id>` / `<fixr:group id>`
are a repository-local surrogate key where `id="0"` is legal, so the Orchestra rule lives in
`parse_orchestra_field_tag` and the false-positive arm
(`OrchestraFailClosed.ZeroStructuralXmlIdsAreStillAccepted`) is what holds the two namespaces
apart. **`table_view`'s own mutator surface was the residue, and fixpp#456 MOVED it rather than
closing it.** The population members are private now and reachable only through
`table_view_builder` — `include/fixpp/dict/table_view.hpp`'s STORAGE banner states the mechanism,
and is the one place that does. The *hazard* is unchanged: the builder accepts everything the view
used to, and `build()` is `return std::move(tv_);` with no validation of any kind, so a hand-built
table can still plant a zero where a loaded dictionary cannot. That is why `B-384-2` was **amended,
not closed** — its wording now names the `table_view_builder` surface instead of the hand-built
view — and why `L-456-1` was filed beside it.

## The reify handle materialises EAGERLY and refuses a failed re-parse (090, fixpp#458)

`fixpp::dict::detail::owning_message_handle_from_frame` (`src/dictionary/reify.cpp`) builds the
handle's view when it mints the handle. Before 090 the build happened lazily, on the first `view()`.
When a dict-backed source's re-parse fails, the factory now returns that wire error through its
`expected_t` channel, and so do `reify()` and the generated dispatch. Before, it fell back silently
to a dict-free view that lost the dictionary's Length+Data pairs. This is `B-458-2`, BREAKING for a
direct C++ caller. The C-ABI twin is `fixpp_msg_clone`; see [`c-api.md`](./c-api.md).

- **Why eager.** `view()` is a `noexcept` accessor that returns a reference, so a refusal found
  lazily had nowhere to go. The factory already had a refusal channel (`dict_reify_oom`). It simply
  ran the fallible work later. The design note's v0.1 had called that deferral a source fact rather
  than a choice.
- **Rejected:** v0.1's three-state status accessor on the handle. It could not report a framing
  failure, and it could not be both non-allocating and post-materialisation.
- **Kept as it was, on purpose:** a framing failure, a framed-but-empty span, and a dict-free view's
  degraded build still return a live handle. Only the re-parse of a frame that framed successfully
  refuses (`include/fixpp/dict/reify.hpp`'s factory comment). `.specify/2c-codegen.md`'s reify
  error entry carries an in-place *"Updated (fixpp#458 …)"* note saying the same.
- **What eager costs, measured at Gate B (PR #494).**
  - **The moved work is not new work:** the framer pass plus the dict-backed parse used to run on the first `view()`, and a caller that reads the handle pays it either way.
  - **It is a small fraction of the factory call.** The factory is dominated by the per-handle `membership_copy()`, which predates 090.
  - ⚠️ **The benchmark that existed before could not see any of this.** `BM_Reify_Dispatch_20tag` passes a view with no MsgType, so `reify()` returns before dispatch. `BM_Reify_DictBacked_20tag` was added to reach the factory. Check that a bench reaches the path it is named for before citing it.
  - **One pre-existing row still went past +5%**, from code *placement*: the function's instructions were identical and its alignment moved.
  - **Rejected:** forcing alignment or moving the function to a separate file to recover it. Either would tune the code to one benchmark and move the layout luck elsewhere.
  - `[const §VIII.2]` makes accepting it a non-author decision. The figures and procedure are in the 090 verify record's *Gate B G-1* section.
- **fixpp#495 / #493 (`.specify/495-493-486-dict-reify-copy.md`):** the factory no longer
  deep-copies the membership table for a view parsed on `Parser`'s **owned route** (every view the
  `Session` hands an application, and every handle's own view); the handle holds one more reference
  to that table, and pins the table only — never the `Dictionary` (D-4). The handle's impl comes
  from `mr` (D-1c). Every copy re-parses under its source's `OffsetTable::Config` (#493). Rejected:
  a public owned route (R-A keeps it `detail`), a `shared_ptr` by value on every view (an atomic
  pair per inbound message), and the owner token inside `dict_hooks` (size-pinned `entry_context`).
  A view parsed through a borrowed `Parser{tv}` still copies (`L-495-1`).
- ⚠️ **Superseded in part (fixpp#493):** 090 made a dict-backed clone of a raised-cap source
  refuse with `FIXPP_ERR_WIRE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`. Frozen 090 records that still describe that
  refusal, flagged here and not edited (frozen `specs/` are not rewritten):
  `specs/090-capi-refusals/contracts/msg-clone.md` §4 and `data-model.md` §4.1 (the
  `wire_offset_table_full` "raised-cap route" row), `quickstart.md` V5, `spec.md` User Story 3's
  *Independent Test*, and `tasks.md` US3 / T047 all describe a source parsed at a raised
  `max_offset_entries` making a dict-backed `fixpp_msg_clone` return
  `FIXPP_ERR_WIRE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`. Since #493 that clone succeeds under the source's own caps:
  `.specify/495-493-486-dict-reify-copy.md` §4 and T-3. The code still comes back for a source
  whose own build failed at the default cap (T-6).
- ⚠️ **Superseded in part (fixpp#495 D-1c):** frozen 057 records describe the
  `owning_message_handle` as a **heap** pimpl, flagged here and not edited (frozen `specs/` are
  not rewritten): `specs/057-behavioral-reify-unblock/data-model.md` E-1, `plan.md`,
  `research.md` and `contracts/reify-dispatch-bridge.md`. Since #495 the impl is allocated from
  the `mr` passed to `reify`, not the global heap: `.specify/495-493-486-dict-reify-copy.md` §2.5
  (D-1c), the `include/fixpp/dict/reify.hpp` class comment, and `B-495-4`. Re-derive the sites
  with `git grep -n -i 'heap pimpl' -- specs/057-behavioral-reify-unblock`.
- ⚠️ **Open residuals:** `L-458-1` covers a dict-backed build that under-indexes near the probe cap
  while reporting success; `L-495-1` the borrowed-route copy. Check the live B&L file before
  treating either as open.

> ⚠️ **Before you write "immutable" about a `table_view`, read that banner.** #456 took three Gate B

## Where the design decisions live

`2c-codegen.md` is **v1.4 post-sign-off** and was scanned clean in the Step-R sweep. ⚠️ Beside it sits
`2c-codegen.draft-r1.md` — an archived **v0.1** holding a design that an adversarial review **rejected**
as needing a full rewrite. It now carries a forward-pointing banner; before 2026-08-29 it did not.
