## ⭐ Why this page exists, and why it is different from the others

Every other component page **supplements** a design doc. This one **substitutes** for the missing one.

`session` is the **second-largest catalogue family** and spans roughly twenty feature bundles — yet
**no `2*` design doc owns it.** `[arch §10]`'s hand-off table, the natural place to look, lists
`2a`–`2m` and **has no session row at all**. The family cites nine design docs
(`2a,2b,2c,2d,2e,2f,2g,2h,2j`) and **not one of them owns it**; each contributes a slice and
explicitly disclaims the spine.

> ⚠️ **This is exactly the hole that a hand-written component inventory would have hidden.** Deriving
> the inventory from `[arch §10]` looked obviously right and would have omitted the FIX engine — the
> heart of the product. Re-derive the current standing, never trust the shape described here:
>
> ```bash
> python3 tools/brain_inventory.py --census
> ```

The authority is therefore split three ways, and knowing the split is most of the value:
**the headers** (what it does), **the Phase-4 `specs/<id>/` bundles** (why, per feature), and
**`spec/behaviors-and-limitations.md`** (what will surprise you).

## Route by question

| You want | Go to |
|---|---|
| The state machine | `include/fixpp/session/session_fsm.hpp`. ⚠️ **The state set is not reproduced here** — `B-005-2` pins it to the `[FIX-SL §4.10]` set, and a copied enum is what rots |
| Establishment, Logon, the FSM's origin | `specs/005-session-establishment-fsm/` |
| Sequence numbers, persistence, hydration | `SeqnumManager`; `specs/029-persistent-seqnum-hydrate/` |
| PossDup / OrigSendingTime / PossResend | `specs/021-…`, `specs/022-…`. ⚠️ **021 FR-004's at-expected "MUST NOT advance … matches QuickFIX" is SUPERSEDED by fixpp#423** (B-423-1); see the rejected alternative below. |
| Resend answers (replay + GapFill) — how `build_replay_frame` / `build_sequence_reset_gapfill` build the wire frame | `specs/013-session-reconnect-binding/spec.md` FR-010; `specs/037-resend-reply-possdup-tags/` (43/122 emission). ⚠️ **037's `spec.md` Assumptions section, `research.md` D-3, `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/resend-reply-wire.md`, and `checklists/wire-conformance.md` CHK010 all describe placing `43`/`122` AFTER the body as "order-safe" / "field order is unconstrained for interop" — FALSE, superseded by fixpp#419: a strict peer (QuickFIX-J `UseDataDictionary=Y`) rejects it (373=14). The bundle is a point-in-time record, left as-is; do not trust its field-order claims. See `spec/behaviors-and-limitations.md` `## fixpp#419` for current behaviour.** ⚠️ **037 FR-006 / SC-003 ("replayed application frames MUST be byte-identical to prior behavior") are also SUPERSEDED, by fixpp#420: a replay restamps `SendingTime(52)`. 013 FR-010's "byte-for-byte" clause governs `122` only and still holds.** See `## fixpp#420 / fixpp#424` in the same file. |
| Reset & refresh on Logon | `specs/024-reset-refresh-on-logon/`, `specs/025-refresh-on-logon/` |
| NextExpectedMsgSeqNum | `specs/027-next-expected-msgseqnum/` |
| FIXT / FIX50SP2, version serviceability | `specs/033-fixt-fix50sp2-session/`, `specs/042-fixt-version-serviceability-guard/` |
| Runtime flows | the flow pages below — no design doc carries them |

## Invariants that span features, and why they exist

| Invariant | Why | Disclosed as |
|---|---|---|
| **Outbound sequence numbers are committed to the `MessageStore` BEFORE the frame hits transport** | ⭐ **the ordering is the durability guarantee.** Reverse it and a crash between write and commit yields a peer that saw a message the store never recorded — unrecoverable by resend | `B-005-5` |
| **`seqnum_t` overflow is session-fatal and requires operator intervention** | it **never silently wraps**; a wrap would silently corrupt the resend contract | `B-005-4` |
| **Acceptor sessions stay in `NotConnected` at `open()` and emit no Logon; only initiators do** | the asymmetry is deliberate — an acceptor has no peer to greet yet | `B-009-1`; pairs with the lazy-connect invariant in [`initiator-connect-path`](./initiator-connect-path.md) |
| **A refused first Logon transitions to `Disconnected`, not back to `NotConnected`** | the two states are not interchangeable: `Disconnected` records that an attempt happened and failed | `B-009-2` |
| **The live inbound path accepts out-of-order header/body fields, including `MsgType` not first** | real counterparties emit them; strictness here buys conformance-theatre and loses interop | `B-005-7` |
| **`open()` refuses a configured string that an admin builder would copy verbatim, if it holds a byte `< 0x20` or `'='`** — CompIDs, BeginString, each `supported_msg_types[].msg_type`, and the credentials | those values reach the wire through `append_raw` unvalidated, so one SOH injects a field. Every admin builder emits CompIDs and BeginString; `build_logon` adds RefMsgType and the credentials when they are configured. ⭐ **ONE predicate, `fixpp::session::contains_forbidden_config_byte`** (`config_byte_floor.hpp`), also called by the C-ABI setters before any `Session` exists. ⚠️ **It is a POLICY floor, not FIX grammar**: fixpp's scanner splits at the *first* `'='`, so `'='` is legal in a value as fixpp parses it. Do not cite it as the grammar | `B-452-1`; residual `L-452-2` |

## What was rejected — the half the code cannot tell you

- **A `RecoveryPending` half-state.** `B-005-2` states there is none: the FSM is *exactly* the
  `[FIX-SL §4.10]` set. An intermediate recovery state is the obvious design and was **not** taken.
- **Receipt of a deferred admin type is a defined, bounded transition** (`B-005-3`) rather than an
  error or an unbounded wait.
- **A bare outbound-sequence field.** Deleted in favour of `SeqnumManager` so two writers could not
  diverge — see [`graceful-logout`](./graceful-logout.md).
- **Keeping the stored `SendingTime(52)` on a replay** (fixpp#420, owner ruling 2026-09-14). The
  obvious reading of "the store is the authority" (013 FR-010), but that clause governs `122`. FIX-SL
  2020 §4.8.4 wants `52` restamped. A peer also rejects an unrestamped replay once it is older than
  the peer's MaxLatency, and that check covers PossDup frames in both QuickFIX engines.
- **Four answers to a stored message whose replay cannot be built** (fixpp#424, owner ruling
  2026-09-14). The chosen one gap-fills the slot and records a
  `session_event_resend_slot_gap_filled` (D4a). Rejected:
  - skipping the slot silently, the pre-#424 behaviour, which leaves the peer's gap open;
  - failing the whole resend (option b), which also leaves the gap open;
  - QuickFIX-cpp's behaviour of abandoning the rest of the range;
  - both QuickFIX engines' `FieldNotFound` on a stored frame with no `52`. fixpp instead replays it with
    `122` := the new `52`, which is what the StandardHeader says to do when the data is unavailable.
- **Rebuilding a replay after the GapFill flush that precedes it** (fixpp#420 review, 2026-09-14).
  The replay is stamped and built before an open gap run is flushed, so that an unbuildable slot can
  join that run. A flush that blocks on the transport therefore leaves the replay's `52` older than
  its send time. Rebuilding after the flush was declined for #420: it costs a second build per replay,
  and the stamp is late only by as long as that one write blocks.
- **Two homes for the configured-byte floor** (090 D-5b, fixpp#452). The first was the function-local
  lambda that `Session::open` used for the credentials. It had no linkage, so
  `src/capi/config.cpp` could not call it. The second was `src/session/file_store_factory.cpp`'s
  comp-id check, which is the wrong layer with the wrong charset: SOH and `'='` pass it, and the
  C-ABI default `MemoryStoreFactory` runs no comp-id check at all. Widening the charset (all C0,
  printable-only) was **not** taken either. It is a separate decision with its own blast radius.
- **Gap-filling a frame too large to capture** (fixpp#424 D5). Rejected *for now*: it stays a loud
  disconnect (`L-424-1`), deferred, and may be reopened.
- **Rejecting a `send()` payload whose header-class field follows a body field** (fixpp#422, owner
  decision 2026-09-14). The field is moved into the header instead; a reject would also have broken
  callers that append `43`/`122` under `allow_pos_dup=true`.
- **One header-tag table for both the send partition and the replay's insertion point** (fixpp#422).
  They pull in opposite directions: the send table (`is_send_header_tag`) must be a SUPERSET of any
  real header, or a header field stays behind the body; the replay's `kReplayHeaderTags` only needs to
  be a SUBSET (B-419-1). Reading the set from the session's dictionary was not taken either (L-422-1).
- **Putting the canonical outbound-tag rule in `wire/tag_scan.hpp`** (fixpp#421). That header serves
  the inbound scanners, which accept zero padding by design; the outbound rule
  (`parse_outbound_tag`) stays in `session.cpp`.
- **Widening `Writer::append_raw` to a 32-bit tag that rejects values above 65535** (fixpp#421). It
  would add an error arm to every literal-tag caller to protect the one runtime-tag caller, the replay,
  which now narrows by type instead.
- **Leaving an in-sequence rejected message's MsgSeqNum unconsumed, "for QuickFIX parity"** (fixpp#423,
  owner ruling 2026-09-14).
  - **Who chose it:** 041 (contract C-3) and 021 (FR-004, at the expected number). 016's thorny
    C-102 witness chose the opposite for the Rejects after the seqnum gate.
  - **Why it was wrong:** the parity claim was false, since both QuickFIX engines' `generateReject`
    increment at the expected number. FIX-SL 2020 §4.5.4 also says NextNumIn *must* be incremented.
  - **What it did live:** the session stalled.
  - **Still not consumed:** a Logon or SequenceReset, a message at any other number, and the
    establishment arms (`consume_rejected_seqnum_`).
  - ⚠️ **041's `contracts/validation-gate.md` C-3 and `spec.md` (Clarifications, FR-003, edge cases),
    and 021's `spec.md` FR-004, still say "does not advance". They are point-in-time records, left
    as-is. See B-423-1.**

## ⚠️ Limitations an integrator must know before trusting this family

⚠️ **This is a SELECTED pair, not the full set** — the family carries roughly a dozen open
`L-` rows across 005 / 009 / 013. **Derive the full list from the live B&L file**; a blind
agent correctly treated this as a shortlist and re-derived, which is the intended use.

- **`L-005-1` — the full `[FIX-TC]` conformance corpus is NOT satisfied.** Only a
  capability-partitioned subset ships. Do not read the size of this family as completeness.
- **`L-005-5` — `OnBehalfOfCompID(115)` / `DeliverToCompID(128)` third-party addressing is not
  implemented.**

⚠️ **A limitation is open only if it is in the LIVE B&L file.** Resolved rows move to
`spec/behaviors-and-limitations-closed.md`, so a repo-wide `grep L-0NN-` reports closed ones as open.
