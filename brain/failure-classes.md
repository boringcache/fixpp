# Recurring failure classes

**This page is a taxonomy, not a list.** These classes have produced most of the defects found in this
project — including several found *in the documents and tools built to prevent them*. Each entry gives
the **trigger** (when you are at risk) and the **procedure** (what refutes it). No counts, no instances.

> ⚠️ **The instances are deliberately NOT here.** They live in a private corpus of ~330 recorded
> defects and are queried at the moment of a trigger, not read up front. Copying a subset into this
> repo would create a second list that drifts from the first — which is class 4 below.

### 1. An instrument fails toward CLEAN

**The single most recurring class.** A check reports "no findings" because it *could not have reported
anything else* — a broken glob, a truncated corpus, a matcher that never matches, a shimmed tool that
prints `0` for a whole syntax.

- **Trigger:** you are about to believe a zero, an empty result, or a green.
- **Procedure:** **prove it can report non-zero first.** Run it against a case you know is positive —
  the unfixed tree, a seeded match, a deliberate mutant. Distrust a *uniform* result especially.
- ⚠️ **A proven PATTERN is not a proven TRAVERSAL.** A matcher demonstrated non-zero on a seeded case
  says nothing about whether the walk reached the corpus — a recursive grep does not descend a
  symlinked root, and a directory never entered is indistinguishable in the output from one that held
  no match. Assert how many files the sweep actually examined, and check whether any root is a link.
- ⚠️ **A self-test written from the implementation certifies the implementation**, bug included. Build
  fixtures from the real artefact, verbatim.
- ⚠️ **A CHECK THAT READS ITS EXPECTATION FROM THE THING IT CHECKS CANNOT FAIL.** The runtime form
  of the entry above, and it survives review because it looks like good hygiene — no duplication, one
  source of truth. If the expected value is built from the producer's own constant, a mutation moves
  **both sides together** and the comparison is inert. It recurs at successively wider scope on the
  same assertion: first the identifier, then the per-site clause, then the shared prefix constant —
  each fix removing one import and leaving the next.
  - **Trigger:** you are writing an expectation, and reaching for a symbol the subject also uses.
  - **Procedure:** spell the expectation out independently and accept the duplication — it *is* the
    mechanism. Then prove it: mutate the shared constant and require RED. A pin that imports
    anything from its subject must be assumed inert until a mutant says otherwise.
- ⚠️ **A POSITIVE CONTROL PROVES THE COMMAND RAN; IT DOES NOT PROVE THE CORPUS HOLDS THE ANSWER.**
  A zero can be done correctly: a different pattern, positive on the same corpus. It can still be
  wrong if the property is not decided in that corpus. 090's design note concluded "libstdc++
  hardening is off everywhere" from a grep of `cmake/`, `CMakeLists.txt` and `CMakePresets.json`,
  with `FIXPP_WERROR` as its control. But `_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS` is a **library default**, on when
  not optimising. No pattern over the project's build files could ever have reported it. A hard
  out-of-range subscript aborted in the debug preset, which was the first sign.
  - **Trigger:** you are concluding that a toolchain or library property is off because no project
    flag sets it.
  - **Procedure:** ask the compiler, not the build files. Preprocess with the real toolchain and
    flags, test the macro, and do it once per optimisation level the presets use.
  - ⭐ **Check what survives before rewriting the conclusion.** In 090 the premise was wrong and the
    decision was not: the defect was a stale but *in-range* index, which no bounds assertion sees at
    any level.
- ⚠️ **PRESENT IS NOT ACTIVE — a witness can prove a mechanism was LOADED and say nothing about
  whether it TOOK EFFECT.** When an instrument works by interposition, injection or overriding
  (LD_PRELOAD, a monkey-patch, a subclass, a mock registered in a container, an interceptor
  installed by a constructor), the natural proof is "did the thing get installed?" — and that proof
  is satisfied in configurations where installation succeeds and OVERRIDING DOES NOT.
  - **Trigger:** your evidence of instrumentation is existence — a file the injector wrote, a
    symbol present in the binary, a constructor that ran, a plugin that imported.
  - **Procedure:** require evidence written by the OVERRIDE ITSELF on the path under test, not by
    the mechanism's arrival. Ask what outranks you: a strong symbol beats a weak one, a sanitizer's
    allocator beats an LD_PRELOAD interposer, an earlier entry in a preload list beats a later one,
    an alternative allocator linked into the binary beats both.
  - ⚠️ **The scan that guards this is usually scoped too narrowly.** A repo checking that no *test*
    redefines the overridden symbol does not see a definition in *production* sources, which is the
    same link closure. Derive the scope from what the LINKER sees, not from where such code is
    expected to live.
  - **Where it lands when true:** the gate reports clean because nothing was ever measured, which is
    class 1 by a different door — and the positive control is the only arm that can tell, because
    it is the only one whose expected result is a FAILURE.
- ⚠️ **A REFUSAL IS ONLY AS WIDE AS THE ESCAPE IT CATCHES — and the escapes that matter exit
  SUCCESSFULLY.** A guard written to turn an unusable input into a named error is itself an
  instrument, so ask what reaches the interpreter *past* it. In Python the sharp edge is that
  `except Exception` does not cover `SystemExit` or `KeyboardInterrupt` (both `BaseException`), so a
  loaded module that calls `sys.exit(0)` does not raise past the guard — **it terminates the whole
  process with status 0**, and every downstream step reads that as success with empty output.
  - **Trigger:** you are guarding a plugin load, an `exec_module`, a config eval, a subprocess
    wrapper — anywhere foreign code runs inside your process and you wrote `except Exception`.
  - **Procedure:** enumerate the escape deliberately (`except (Exception, SystemExit)` catches the
    threat without swallowing an operator's ^C), and **write the arm that exits zero** — a fixture
    whose body is `sys.exit(0)`, asserted to produce the named refusal. A syntax-error fixture does
    not cover this: it tests a different branch and is the arm people write.
  - **And state the bound you did not close.** `os._exit()` is uncatchable by anything; when that is
    the residue, the surviving defence belongs one level out (a caller asserting the output is
    non-empty), named at both ends rather than assumed.
- ⚠️ **A THRESHOLD THAT FLAKES IS USUALLY ALSO BLIND, AND THE FLAKE IS THE HALF YOU NOTICE.** A
  wall-clock band derived as a *ratio to some other timeout* rather than measured against the
  behaviour rejects by machine load — the visible symptom, which gets an issue filed. Ask the other
  question: **what defect would this assertion let through?** #394's `EXPECT_LT(elapsed, 100ms)` on
  *"cancellation must be PROMPT, not merely eventual"* stayed **green** under a cancellation that
  resolved only after 50 extra scheduler dispatches — 0 ms of wall clock, the exact class it names —
  while going red at 357 ms on an instrumented lane with no defect at all. **Procedure:** find the
  load-invariant quantity and assert on that. Instrumentation slows each handler; it does not add
  handlers, so a count of `io_context` turns held at 2/1 across 27 runs spanning debug, TSan, idle
  and 4× oversubscription. ⚠️ Fixing only the false-RED leaves an assertion that still cannot fail,
  and makes it look repaired.
- ⚠️ **A BOUND THAT IS LEXICALLY OUTSIDE THE THING IT BOUNDS MAY BE INSIDE IT AT RUNTIME.** A bounded
  driver around a blocking call bounds nothing if the blocking call ends up executing *on the driving
  thread*, inside a handler that driver dispatched: the driver never gets another turn, and the bound
  it looks like it has is never re-tested. Reading the source suggests a bound; only running the
  wedge shows there is none. **Procedure:** inject a defect the wait cannot recover from and time it.
  If it hangs, the outer bound was decoration.
- ⚠️ **A RESIDUAL BUCKET GOING TO ZERO IS NOT THE CLASS GOING TO ZERO.** When a sweep classifies on
  axes that do not encode the mechanism you fixed, the sites it puts in "your" bucket are the ones
  that happened to land there. Say which bucket moved, not which shape is done — and check whether
  the sweep can even *see* the shape (a `.get()` on a range-for variable over a container of futures
  is not a receiver most sweeps can trace to its spawn).
  **Closed for this instrument in #289 batch 20, and the fix is the general lesson: give the sweep
  an axis for the MECHANISM.** `ci/pump-get-sweep.sh` gained a call-site-scope axis (is the `.get()`
  inside an `awaitable`-returning function or lambda?) and container tracking. Teaching it the
  receiver shape moved a whole population of previously-invisible sites into the candidate list,
  among them the coroutine-side wedge shape, in a file batch 19 never opened. Current figures:
  `bash ci/pump-get-sweep.sh --disposition`.
  ⚠️ **The scope discriminator must be STRUCTURAL — the return type — not keyword presence.** "The
  enclosing scope contains a `co_await`" is satisfied by a TEST body that merely *spawns* a
  coroutine, so it marks the caller-side `.get()` after that lambda's closing brace as coroutine-side
  and reports nearly the whole corpus. Both readings pass a hand-check; only a control that puts one
  `.get()` inside the lambda and one immediately after it separates them.
- ⚠️ **A NEW AXIS WHOSE HEADLINE IS A ZERO NEEDS A KNOWN-NON-ZERO CORPUS, AND THE OLD TREE IS ONE.**
  Batch 20's axis is meant to report **zero** coroutine-side candidates, and a zero is exactly what a
  broken traversal or a wrong root also produces; its synthetic controls prove only that the axis
  *can* say CORO. `ci/red-arms/batch20-coroutine-axis.sh`
  runs the **current** instrument against `tests/` at the pre-batch-19 commit — where the same sites
  were unguarded — and requires non-zero. Same instrument, older corpus: a git object is immutable,
  so the pin is a fixed corpus rather than a claim that rots. Extract only the corpus; checking out
  the whole old tree would run the OLD instrument and pass by construction.
- ⚠️ **A GREEN SUITE IS EVIDENCE ABOUT THE EXECUTABLE YOU RAN, NOT ABOUT THE DIRECTORY IT IS NAMED
  AFTER.** One source directory routinely fans out into several test binaries, and the one whose name
  reads like the directory is rarely all of it. Reporting "`<dir>_tests` N/N" then reads as coverage
  of the change's blast radius when it is coverage of a *subset chosen by a build file you did not
  open* — and the cells outside it can be exactly the ones the change breaks, because nothing about
  the failure distinguishes "not run" from "passed". **Derive the target list from the build system**
  (`ninja -t targets`, the `add_executable` set) rather than from the directory name, and say which
  binaries a green covers. In this repo one directory's cells sit in ten separate executables.
- ⚠️ **A control set thorough about ONE of an instrument's configurations proves nothing about the
  others.** If the instrument is parameterised — two closing markers, two directories, two presets,
  two file classes — then "the controls pass" is a claim about whichever parameter the controls
  happened to use. Enumerate the configurations the *real run* uses and require a control per
  configuration; a suite that is exhaustive within one of them still reports PROVEN while another is
  broken.
- ⚠️ **A CORRECT INSTRUMENT WATCHING A CONDITION NOTHING CAN VIOLATE FAILS TOWARD CLEAN JUST THE
  SAME**, and it arrives from the opposite direction — not a broken check, a sound one whose subject
  cannot go wrong. #289 batch 18 built exactly the barrier its own design argument called for (expose
  `mock_clock`'s parked-waiter count, since `advance()` already computes the woken set) and had to
  remove it: at BOTH sites it was written for, a mutation that should have made it fire left the cell
  GREEN, because the mock clock is monotonic and those cells assert on total elapsed time rather than
  on a per-advance wake. **The argument was sound; the measurement killed it.** So the trigger is not
  "does this check look right" but *"show me the mutation that makes it RED"* — and if there is no
  such mutation in the tree, the check is an assertion that cannot fail and does not ship.
- ⚠️ **AN INSTRUMENT WHOSE RESIDUAL RISES WHEN YOU FIX A SITE IS MISCOUNTING, AND THE DIRECTION IS THE
  TELL.** `ci/pump-get-sweep.sh` matched `using R = decltype(fut.get());` as a `.get()` call — an
  UNEVALUATED operand — and that idiom is part of the settled value-helper recipe, so every migrated
  value helper ADDED a row to the residual it was reducing. Nothing in the count looked wrong; only
  the sign of the change did. **Before believing a residual, migrate one site and check the number
  moved the way you expect.**
- ⚠️ **Controls anchored to REAL artefacts assert a contingent fact about today's tree; controls built
  from SYNTHETIC fixtures assert a property of the instrument.** Prefer synthetic. A real-file anchor
  fails when the tree legitimately changes, and a later reader cannot distinguish a rotted anchor from
  a broken instrument.
- ⚠️ **WHEN THE INSTRUMENT IS A PREDICATE OVER A GRAMMAR, ENUMERATE THE PRODUCTION — NOT THE EXAMPLES
  YOU CAN THINK OF.** A fix's own controls are written by whoever held the wrong model, so they
  inherit its blind spot, and brainstorming cases samples exactly the model that was wrong. Reading
  the production is the only step that does not. #289 batch 17: a lexer read every `'` as opening a
  character literal, so a C++14 digit separator (`10'000`) started a literal that ran to the next
  apostrophe and blanked every intervening line, code included. The fix shipped with controls for
  `10'000`, `0x1F'FF` and `u8'0'` — and a reviewer immediately produced `.1'0`, which the grammar
  admits (`fractional-constant: digit-sequence_opt . digit-sequence`) and which the fix still ate.
  The examples were the wrong instrument for choosing examples.
- ⚠️ **A FORMATTER CHANGES WHAT A SOURCE-READING INSTRUMENT SEES WITHOUT CHANGING WHAT THE PROGRAM
  DOES, so run those gates AFTER formatting.** C++ concatenates adjacent string literals and
  `clang-format` splits one that crosses the column limit; a gate harvesting "the last string literal
  in the call" then reads only the tail. #289 batch 17's label-uniqueness gate was GREEN before
  `clang-format` and reported a nonexistent duplicate after it — and the same defect has a
  fails-toward-clean sign: two sites carrying the SAME label, one split and one not, harvest as `tail`
  and `full` and read as DISTINCT. The runtime value never moved; only the instrument's view of it did.
- ⚠️ **A FIX for a false-clean is itself an instrument change, and routinely introduces the NEXT
  false-clean.** Measured: one detector took three rounds, each remedy creating the next hole —
  anchoring on one physical line, then swallowing a region whose parens were unbalanced *inside a
  string literal*, then leaking guard state across functions because the previous fix narrowed a
  window instead of removing the assumption. **Re-run every earlier control after each fix, and add
  the new mode as a control before believing the fix.** A remedy that only closes the reported case
  is class 2 wearing an instrument's clothes.
- ⚠️ **A CLASSIFIER'S FALLBACK IS A CLAIM, AND A FALLBACK SET TO THE COMMON CASE FAILS TOWARD THE
  EASY ANSWER.** This is the no-result path wearing a value: the search does not return "empty", it
  returns *the answer most rows have*, so a row the instrument could not classify is indistinguishable
  in the output from one it classified correctly. Measured in `classify-289.py`: the walk that finds a
  census site's enclosing function returned `("TEST", "<none>")` on exhaustion, and TEST-body is
  exactly the shape whose migration recipe is the simplest — so three rows inside an
  `extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` harness that links no gtest were offered for a migration
  whose miss branch is `ADD_FAILURE()`. **Two independent causes** put them there (a signature regex
  that `extern "C"` defeats, and a lookahead the function sits beyond), and neither was visible,
  because a correct row and a fallback row printed identically. Give the unresolved case its **own**
  value, outside every recipe bucket, so a consumer filtering on the recipes drops it instead of
  migrating it — and add a control that fails if the fallback is reverted, since a control asserting
  the common case would have passed the whole time it was wrong.

- ⚠️ **AN ORACLE'S ERROR ROUTED INTO THE "NOT APPLICABLE" BRANCH IS THE SAME FALLBACK, AND IN A GATE
  IT FAILS OPEN.** The classifier's-fallback form above, applied to a trust decision. In fixpp#490's
  first fix, `git rev-parse` failing was read as "not a git tree", and that branch keeps the old,
  permissive behaviour. So the stale pin the patch exists to refuse resolved at rc 0 again. The
  realistic trigger needed no caller action: git refuses a repository it considers of *dubious
  ownership*. **Procedure:** enumerate the oracle's outcomes (answer / legitimately absent / could not
  tell) and give *could not tell* its own branch, which refuses. Prove "absent" positively, e.g. that
  no `.git` exists at or above the root. Then force the failure (`GIT_TEST_ASSUME_DIFFERENT_OWNER=1`,
  a nonexistent `GIT_DIR`) and require the refusal. (PR #496, Gate B round 1.)

- ⚠️ **A SHELL PIPELINE CAN TURN A SUCCESSFUL MATCH INTO A FAILURE, AND IT DOES SO ONLY ON LARGE
  INPUTS.** Under `set -o pipefail`, `printf '%s' "$out" | grep -q PATTERN` exits **141** when the
  pattern MATCHES: `grep -q` stops at the first hit and closes the pipe, `printf` takes SIGPIPE, and
  pipefail propagates it. Measured in `ci/pump-red-arm.sh`, where the `else` branch reads *"NO
  REPORT — the miss branch did not announce itself"*: three correctly-migrated sites were reported
  SILENT. **It is size-dependent**, so it had shipped a batch earlier and passed every time — with
  little output `printf` finishes before `grep` exits. A fixture-sized self-test cannot see it.
  Use a herestring (`grep -q PATTERN <<<"$out"`). ⚠️ **The tell is a contradiction, not an error**:
  the matcher says "not found" while the surrounding diagnostic prints the very text it wanted —
  chase that rather than re-reading the pattern.

- ⚠️ **Ask what the instrument does when it finds NOTHING — and require that to be an error.** An
  extractor that runs to EOF, a query that returns empty, a matcher that never fires: if the
  no-result path exits 0 and yields a value, the value is wrong and confident. **Fail closed**, then
  mutate the tool to confirm the closed path is reachable.

- ⚠️ **A CLASSIFICATION REACHED BY FALLBACK IS NOT A MEASUREMENT, EVEN WHEN IT IS RIGHT.**
  `ci/pump-get-sweep.sh`'s container path never parsed the spawn executor: `_PUSH_SPAWN` captured
  only the container name, so `base` was the tail of the push statement (`use_future));`). That name
  is in no executor set, so every container row fell through to `THREAD-IN-FILE` or `CALLER-ONLY` by
  one boolean — for a whole batch, on a corpus where those answers happened to be correct. It never
  failed toward clean **only because both fallbacks are the escalating ones**; the same defect on a
  `thread_pool`-filled container is a *positive dismissal*. **The tell is not a wrong output, it is
  an output that does not depend on the input** — mutate the extractor and check that some row moves.
  ⚠️ And when the fix converts escalations into positive dismissals (7 rows, `THREAD-IN-FILE` →
  `THREADED`), read every one by hand: correcting an instrument in the *safe* direction is still a
  change in the *unsafe* direction for the rows it reclassifies. (#289 batch 21.)

- ⚠️ **A phrase grep over comments cannot see a phrase that WRAPS.** In fixpp#495's Gate B, round 2's
  check for a stale claim (`git grep -n -i 'heap pimpl' -- include src` must be empty) was already
  empty on the UNFIXED tree. The phrase in `reify.cpp` was split `heap` / `// pimpl` across two
  comment lines, so round 1's sweep, which used the same grep, had missed it too. **Procedure:** before
  searching, join each line wrap with its comment leader (`//`, `#`, `*`, `>`) into a single space,
  then match `word[\s-]+word`. Prove the search finds the known site on the unfixed tree first.

**The same class, in a benchmark: a timing row that never runs the code it is cited for.**
- A flat paired delta reads as "no cost". It is only evidence if the timed loop reaches the changed path.
- The 090 case (PR #494, Gate B): the existing reify row passed a view with no MsgType, so `reify()` returned before the factory it was cited for.
- **Procedure:**
  - Prove the bench reaches the path: a mutant that slows or deletes the path must move the number, or trace one iteration.
  - Size small moved work with an attribution bench that times it alone. A small cost inside a large, noisy call is below resolution, not absent.

### 2. A fix that replaces a wrong claim with a NEW claim reproduces the defect

Rounds of review converge only when a claim is **deleted**, not refreshed. A corrected claim is still a
claim, and it rots on the same schedule as the one it replaced.

- **Trigger:** you are about to fix a wrong statement by writing a truer statement.
- **Procedure:** ask whether the statement is needed at all. Prefer **the condition plus the command
  that re-derives it** over any value. A deletion cannot manufacture the next round's finding.

### 3. A document may record a PROCEDURE; it may not record a RESULT

Counts, byte offsets, "N sites", pasted output — all go stale, and **silently**, because nothing
re-runs a document. What follows from *structure* cannot rot; what follows from a *caller* can.

- **Trigger:** you are about to write a number, a list, or a measurement into a document.
- **Procedure:** keep the condition and the recipe; delete the answer. If the number is load-bearing,
  say so and name the command that regenerates it.
- **Provenance is a result too.** "Unedited", "kept green", "no test is rewritten by this change" are claims about a diff that is still growing, and any later commit in the same PR can falsify them.
  - In PR #494's Gate B, a round's own comment fix made its "UNEDITED" note false.
  - Write the condition a reader can re-check, such as "exercised by `<cell>`", never the history.

### 4. A copy propagates a claim that is false at the new site

A doc that quotes governing text — a constitution article, a sibling's contract — goes false the moment
the source is amended, and **nothing links the two**. A "verbatim because normative" quote reads as
*more* authoritative and is checked *less* often.

- **Trigger:** you are about to reproduce text, a type, or a rule that something else owns.
- **Procedure:** link, don't copy. If you must copy, name the source and the date, and expect it to rot.
- **Scanning heuristic:** grep for `verbatim`, `normative`, `quoted`.

### 5. A correction can carry the same bias as the claim it corrects

Finding one real error licenses neighbouring "corrections" that were never checked. **A fossil list
that over-reports is not the safe direction** — it spends the reader's trust, and it can point at a
"fix" that breaks a working invariant.

- **Trigger:** you just found one error and are writing up several.
- **Procedure:** re-derive **each** neighbouring claim independently against source. Check the
  *qualifier*, not just the number.

### 6. The reviewed artifact may not be the shippable one

A green run on an older commit, a doc amended in a different tree, a self-reported cost that cannot see
delegated work, a gate that skipped rather than passed.

- **Trigger:** you are about to accept evidence produced somewhere other than where the change lives.
- **Procedure:** check the SHA, the tree, and the *scope* of what ran. `continue-on-error` makes an
  `exit 1` inert; a path-skipped required check never reports at all.

### 7. Removing a spurious gate unmasks whatever the gate was holding back

A rejection you have *correctly* proven wrong is still a rejection. Deleting it is right, and it also
lets input reach code behind it that has never run on that input — code whose own correctness was never
tested there, because nothing ever got that far.

- **Trigger:** you are about to make something loadable, reachable, or acceptable that previously was
  not — fixing a false rejection, widening a filter, relaxing a guard proven over-strict.
- **Procedure:** ask what sits BEHIND the gate that has never seen this input, and test *that*, not
  only the gate. Diff acceptance in both directions: enumerate what the old code rejected and the new
  code accepts, then check each one is handled correctly downstream.
- ⚠️ **The unmasked defect usually has the OPPOSITE polarity.** The gate failed closed, so what it hid
  fails open — a rejection becomes a silently wrong answer rather than a louder rejection. Verifying
  "the thing I fixed now works" cannot see it; only the acceptance diff can.

### 8. Consolidating N copies dissolves the population an audit asserts over

Deduplication is usually unambiguous progress: one definition instead of six, one place to fix a bug.
What it also does — silently — is empty out any instrument whose job was to compare the copies. That
instrument does not report "my population is gone"; it reports whatever its extractor does on inputs
it was never designed for, and the reading of that output is usually "clean" or "broken", neither of
which is "this check no longer has anything to check".

- **Trigger:** you are hoisting a constant, extracting a shared helper, or collapsing duplicated
  blocks — and somewhere there is a consistency check, a byte-identity audit, a "these must agree"
  test, or a lint keyed to the duplication.
- **Procedure:** run that check BEFORE and AFTER. Then make the after-state *coherent* rather than
  merely quiet. The choices are to retire the check with its reason recorded, or to re-aim it at what
  the consolidation now makes true.
- ⚠️ **A SELECTOR THAT WAS EXACT BECOMES A PROXY.** This is the specific mechanism, and it is easy to
  miss because the selector's text does not change: a population picked by "the file mentions `X`" is
  identical to "the file DEFINES `X`" exactly while every mention sits beside its definition.
  Consolidation breaks that equivalence in one step — every former definer still *uses* the name — so
  the selector keeps matching and starts meaning something else.
- ⚠️ **An empty population is only evidence if the instrument is shown able to report a non-empty
  one.** Retire the population, keep a synthetic positive control that constructs the thing the
  selector looks for and requires it to be found. Otherwise "empty" and "broken" print identically —
  which is class 1 reached by a different road.

- ⚠️ **A HARNESS THAT RELOCATES THE THING UNDER TEST BREAKS WHEN THAT THING GAINS AN IMPORT.** The
  consolidated helper is resolved at runtime relative to the script, so a harness that copies or
  mutates the script into a temp directory now dies with a module-resolution error — which its own
  assertion reports as "the scanner failed", i.e. the right verdict for the wrong reason. Run the
  harness after the consolidation, and make the sandbox carry the module.

**Reference instance:** #289 batch 10. `kWindowMissSentinel` was copy-defined in three test files and
`audit-copy-span.sh` asserted byte-identity over the span containing it. Hoisting the constant into
`tests/support/pump_until_ready.hpp` left all three files still *mentioning* the name, so the
bare-token selector still selected them while the span they were selected for no longer existed —
three `EXTRACTOR FAILED` lines. The fix was to make the selector match the definition, not the token;
the FULL population is now empty by construction, and the control that builds a synthetic definer each
run is what makes that emptiness readable.

---

### 9. A correctness fix leaves the OLD rule standing on the path that lacked the information

The usual shape of a boundary fix is: thread in the thing the rule needed — a dictionary, a real
parent context, an actual bound — and compute the answer properly. That fix lands on the branch that
now has the information. The branch that never will keeps the old rule, and keeps it *silently*,
because nothing about it looks unfinished: it still compiles, its tests still pass, and within a
release or two somebody writes a waiver explaining why it is acceptable. At that point the leftover
has acquired the appearance of design, and the next reader — including the next reader who is
looking straight at it — will treat it as a deliberate degradation rather than as the fragment it is.

- **Trigger:** you are fixing a rule by supplying the information it was missing, and some branch
  (no dictionary, no context, no oracle) will not receive it.
- **Procedure:** decide what that branch *answers*, and write the answer down as a contract. The
  honest options are three: **decline** — return the same "not applicable" the informed path returns
  when it cannot establish the thing; **keep the old rule** with its wrongness named in the
  signature's own documentation; or **make the un-informed construction unspellable by omission** —
  strip the defaulted parameter, so the branch is entered only by a call site that wrote the null on
  purpose. Do not leave it as a fallback. A fallback is a decision nobody has made yet, and it will
  be read as one that was.
- ⚠️ **THE THIRD OPTION ALSO HANDS YOU THE INSTRUMENT.** Removing the default turns every
  half-threaded site into a **compile error**, so the population is enumerated by the compiler
  instead of by a source sweep — which is what converts *"no production caller takes this path"*
  from a claim into a measurement. It costs a source-compatibility break and nothing at runtime.
- ⚠️ **AND IT IS ONLY HALF A CURE UNLESS YOU CHECK THE ANSWER SPACE.** Stripping the default removes
  the un-informed spelling *by omission*; it does not remove the branch if the supplied callback can
  still ANSWER "absent". fixpp#384's delimiter oracle returns `0` for "not a group", and the splitter
  keeps the wire value on `0` — so a zero-returning callback reaches the leftover with no caller
  writing a null, and a *"we thread it everywhere"* claim is falsifiable by a stub. **Strip the
  default AND check that the callback's answer space carries no value equivalent to absence** —
  otherwise you have moved the un-informed spelling rather than removed it. The same test kills the
  obvious "just decline when the callback is null" fix, for the same reason.
- ⚠️ **THE STRUCTURAL CURE FOR A DISJUNCTION IS TO STOP HAVING ONE.** Where the guard reads
  `a == nullptr || b == nullptr` because two things must be supplied together, the change that
  removes the class is to bundle them into one value with a both-or-neither invariant, so there is
  one predicate and no disjunct that can lose its subject. It is a wider blast radius than a
  single-issue fix usually takes; record it as considered when you defer it, or the next reader
  will read the narrower fix as the whole answer.
- ⚠️ **A JUSTIFICATION GOES STALE BY LOSING ITS SUBJECT, NOT BY DRIFTING.** Where the branch is
  guarded by a **disjunction**, check what each disjunct is actually argued for. A later fix can
  delete one disjunct and leave the other running on a sentence written about the deleted one — and
  unlike a line-number citation, that sentence still reads as current, because nothing about it has
  changed. This is how fixpp#384 arose out of fixpp#220's own fix. **When you delete a disjunct,
  re-read what justified the guard, not just what the guard did.**
- ⚠️ **A WAIVER'S PREMISE IS A FACT ABOUT THE CALL GRAPH, NOT ABOUT THE CODE.** "No production caller
  takes this path" is the standard justification, and it is exactly the kind of claim that decays
  without touching the file it justifies. One default constructor, one convenience overload, one
  caller who did not know to pass the dictionary, and the waived path is the shipping path — with
  the waiver still sitting there reading as current. When you rely on such a premise, name the
  constructor or call site that would falsify it, so the next reader can re-check it in one grep
  instead of re-deriving the call graph.
- ⚠️ **THE REPORTED SYMPTOM IS USUALLY THE SMALLER HALF.** A leftover rule produces a wrong *value*,
  and the bug report names whichever consumer noticed. Enumerate every consumer of that value before
  scoping the fix. Fixing the reported consumer while the wrong value still flows to the others is
  the outcome this class is really about, and it closes the issue while the defect stands.

**Reference instance:** fixpp#220. `OffsetTable::group()` bounded a repeating group by rest-of-message
when no dictionary was threaded. That rule was the surviving fragment of a heuristic whose
end-of-message fallback had been removed from the dict-aware path as a P1 two gate-rounds into PR #68;
it stayed where membership was unavailable, and was later documented as a scoped `[2b §4.7]`
deviation, waived on "no production wire caller uses the dict-free construction path". That premise
had already been false once — `Session::parse_and_dispatch_` built its `Parser` with the
dictionary-free default constructor, so every inbound-dispatched message took the waived path until
066 — and `Parser<Mode>::Parser() = default` is public API besides. The filed symptom was a cap false
positive; the same over-extent also fed `group_slices_status()` and so the typed `group_view<GroupT>`,
which is the half nobody had reported. Resolved by declining rather than by a better guess: with no
dictionary the boundary is undefined per `[FIX50SP2 §3]`, which is also why both reference engines
form no group at all without one.

**Second instance, produced BY the first: fixpp#384.** `group()`'s decline is guarded by
`opaque_dict_ == nullptr || group_member_fn_ == nullptr`. The instance splitter one function over —
`group_slices_status()` — has the sibling guard `opaque_dict_ == nullptr || group_delim_fn_ ==
nullptr`, and 083's contract justified its wire-derived fallback by arguing the **first** disjunct
only. #220 deleted that disjunct; the sentence stayed, over the disjunct it was never about, and read
as a deliberate design for one release. Two things distinguish this instance from its parent and are
why it is recorded rather than folded in: the leftover was **not wrong in the same way** — the wire
delimiter is membership-validated before use, so it is always a member of the right group, where
#220's extent had no oracle at all — and the fix was the **third** option above rather than a
decline. ⚠️ **The first reason recorded for that choice was wrong, and its wrongness is the more
useful half.** It said declining was *"measured RED"* against
`TypedReadSplitAgreement.OutOfScopeWireProbesUnchanged`, which builds the half-threaded table on
purpose as its pre-083 baseline. True, but that witness passes `nullptr` only as a *spelling* — a
zero-returning oracle yields the same delimiter and the same slices, so a one-line fixture change
removes the cost entirely. **A cost a one-line fixture change removes is not a design constraint**, and citing it as
one is this class's own error committed inside this class's own fix. The reason that survives is the
answer-space bullet above: declining on a null callback does not remove the branch, because a
callback answering 0 still reaches it. See [`components/wire`](./components/wire.md) and
`spec/behaviors-and-limitations.md` B-384-1 / B-384-2 / L-384-1.

### 10. An ASSESSMENT scoped to one of a change's effects certifies a site the OTHER effect breaks

**Trigger.** A contract, review clause, or spec obligation says *"feature F changes X, so its effect
on site S must be assessed."* You run the assessment honestly, it comes back clean, and it is
recorded as a verdict on S.

**Why it fails.** The assessment is scoped to X. If F also changes **Y**, and S depends on Y, the
clean result on X says nothing — but it *reads* as a clearance for S, and it is filed as one. The
site is now certified by a measurement that never looked at what broke it, which is worse than
having no assessment at all: the next reader sees a discharged obligation and stops.

**Instance (fixpp#389, found two features later).** 083's C-8.0a obliged an assessment of whether the
feature's changed **member sets** perturbed `group_slices_reserve_bound()`. They did not. Correct,
recorded, and useless — because the same feature also changed the **split loop's delimiter**
(C-8.2), and the estimator's bound was an inference from a differently-delimited loop. The recorded
verdict generalised to *"the under-reserve failure mode is impossible by construction"* while the
mode was live on the shipped path, exhibited by 083's own witness.

**Procedure.**
- **Enumerate what the change touches, then ask the assessment question once PER effect.** "We
  assessed S" is not a claim; "we assessed S against effect X" is. Write the scope into the verdict
  sentence — a scoped sentence cannot be over-read later.
- ⚠️ **When retracting, retract the SENTENCE, not the leg.** #389's Leg 1 body was scoped
  (*"unreachable through a member-set change"*) and stays TRUE; only the unscoped verdict above it
  was false. Condemning the whole leg would have destroyed a correct argument and taught the wrong
  lesson — and over-broad correction is class 5's own trap.
- **A satisfied obligation is the most dangerous kind of stale record**, because it is filed under
  "done". When a site's justification depends on an invariant, name the INVARIANT in the clause, not
  the assessment that happened to hold that day.

**Instance (fixpp#495, caught before the PR by the per-effect bench).** The design note assessed
`MessageView`'s new owner pointer against the effect it was added for: Index-mode views reaching the
reify and clone copy sites. It concluded that no size pin moves. But the member sat on the class
TEMPLATE, so every `access_mode` paid for it, including `Iter`, whose views never reach a copy site.
`BM_Parser_Iter_20tag` went +6.7…+8.5% in 5 of 5 A-B pairs (+8 B per view, plus one store per
parse). The fix (`06eada45`) makes the member Index-only
(`[[no_unique_address]] std::conditional_t<Mode == Index, T, empty>`) and guards its stores with
`if constexpr`. **Procedure:** a member added to a class template is an effect on EVERY
instantiation. Assess, and bench, each mode's row, not only the mode the change targets.

**Sibling.** Where class 9 is a justification that lost its SUBJECT, this is a justification that
kept its subject and lost its SCOPE. Both are recorded on the same site pair (`#384`, `#389`) because
083 produced one of each, in the same function, from the same one-line delimiter change.

### 11. An inherited obligation can rest on a false premise, and discharging it faithfully hides that

A handover, a spec, or a previous batch hands you *"check X per file"*. Doing it is the honest
reading of the instruction. But a per-item obligation is a **claim about why the check is needed**,
and that claim can be wrong — in which case every faithful reading reaches the right verdict for the
wrong reason, and the wrong reason survives into the next handover.

- **Trigger:** an obligation whose cost scales with a population, especially one inherited rather
  than derived. *"Confirm that per file rather than inheriting this paragraph."*
- **Procedure:** before discharging it, ask what makes the check necessary, and try to **measure the
  premise once** instead of applying it N times. Where the premise turns out to hold, you have lost
  little; where it does not, you have replaced N judgements with a structural argument **and** found
  the conditions under which it fails — which is the part nobody was looking for.
- **Instance.** #289 batch 20 handed over ~27 container `.get()` sites with the condition
  *"exhaustion implies completion only while every suspension point of the awaited coroutine is an
  async op on that context."* False: `asio::co_spawn` holds `outstanding_work.tracked` on the SPAWN
  executor for the frame's lifetime, so a live frame is work **whatever it is parked on**. The 27
  readings collapse to a few lexical clauses — and clause 2 (a `run()` on an already-stopped context
  dispatches nothing) is a hazard the per-file instruction never mentioned and nobody had swept for.
  `tests/sync/test_co_spawn_work_guard_contract.cpp` is what measures it; record
  `decisions/speckit/pr-batch21-the-work-guard-and-the-condition-that-was-false.md`.
- ⚠️ **The corollary, and it is the usable half: the reason a survey is expensive is sometimes that
  its premise is wrong.** N readings that each conclude "safe" are N chances to conclude it for the
  wrong reason. Batch 20's own first pass over these sites did exactly that.

**Sibling.** Class 3 says a document may not record a RESULT. This says an obligation may not be
inherited as a PREMISE — same failure viewed from the instruction side rather than the record side.

### 12. One label can carry two arguments, and only one of them may be checked

A classifier emits a value that reads as settled. The value is *correct* at every site. But the
sentence defining it is satisfied by two different situations, which are safe for two different
reasons — and only one of those reasons has ever been checked. Nothing fails, nothing **can** fail,
and every reader who meets the label takes away the reason that does not apply.

This is not class 1: the instrument is not failing toward clean, it is reporting truthfully. The
defect is that its vocabulary is coarser than its subject.

- **Trigger:** a classifier value whose definition contains an *or* you cannot see — most often a
  positional or lexical predicate (*"appears above"*, *"is present in the file"*) standing in for a
  semantic one (*"happens before"*, *"drives this"*). Ask: **for each site with this label, which
  argument makes it safe? Is it the same argument?**
- **Procedure:** do not widen the check. **Split the value**, so the rows resting on the unchecked
  argument count themselves, and report the split. A count you can see is a reading you can order;
  a count folded into a green word is one nobody will ever ask about. Keep the union stable so the
  earlier trend is still comparable.
- **Instance.** #289's `EXHAUSTED` meant *"a run-to-exhaustion naming the spawn context appears above
  the get"*. Satisfied by a **caller-side** run (dismissed by the `co_spawn` work guard, measured in
  batch 21) and by a run that is **not a bare caller-side statement** (dismissed by the self-driving
  argument, whose clauses nothing checked). Batch 22 split off `EXHAUSTED-NOT-CALLER-SIDE`: **all 35
  `THREADED` rows are the second kind, none the first.** Four batches had read them as dominated for
  a reason that did not apply.
- ⚠️ **THE SPLIT'S OWN DISCRIMINATOR IS WHERE THIS CLASS RECURS.** The first one asked *"does this
  statement name a thread type"* — a predicate over what a statement MENTIONS, standing in for one
  about where the code RUNS. It survived two hostile rounds, each checking whether the list of
  spellings was complete, while it was still dismissing two live rows. Structure answered it: a
  caller-side run is one at brace depth 0. Do not iterate on the vocabulary of a predicate that is
  the wrong KIND of predicate. Record
  `decisions/speckit/pr-batch22-the-self-driving-clauses-and-the-annotation-that-hid-two-arguments.md`.
- ⚠️ **A correct check that escalates almost its whole population is not a check.** The same batch
  extended a clause check to those rows; it was right in every particular and escalated **34 of 36**,
  because the corpus retires the context on a bail-out branch the site never reaches. It was
  reverted, with the measurement recorded at the check, because an instrument nobody can act on
  teaches its readers to skip the fraction that mattered too.

**Sibling.** Class 1 is an instrument that *cannot* report the bad answer. This is an instrument that
reports a **true** answer which two different populations both satisfy — the failure is in the
vocabulary, not the mechanism, so no amount of proving the check can fire will surface it.

### 13. An instrument keyed on an IDENTIFIER is blind to duplication of what it names

A census, ratchet or audit enumerates its population by naming things — a helper, a symbol, a
definition site. Copy the thing, and the copy is not in the population. The instrument then reports
the original as **retired** while an instance of it is still live, and it does so truthfully: the
name it was watching really is gone.

- **Trigger:** any population defined by *where a thing is defined* or *what it is called*, over a
  corpus where copying is normal — test helpers above all, where a distinct translation unit is a
  standing, legitimate reason to duplicate rather than share.
- **Procedure:** enumerate by **shape**, not by name, at least once — the body, the signature, the
  idiom. Where that is impractical, treat every *"copied rather than shared"* comment as a census
  entry in its own right, because it is the only record that the copy exists.
- **Instance.** #289's sibling-helper census lists helper #5 by its definition site — the `run_until`
  helper in `engine_firstframe_test.cpp`, *"caller-supplied budget / 50 ms slice, in-loop restart"*.
  That file collapsed onto the shared seam and now defines no `run_until` at all, so the row read as
  migrated — while `first_frame_stop_test.cpp` still carried a copy of it, whose own comment said it
  had been *"copied rather than shared"* from exactly that file. ⚠️ The census cites that helper BY
  LINE NUMBER, and the line had itself rotted — which is how the number reached this page on the
  first draft, and why it is not repeated here (#310). The copy outlived both its
  original and the census entry that would have counted it. Record
  `decisions/speckit/pr-batch22-the-self-driving-clauses-and-the-annotation-that-hid-two-arguments.md` §10.
- ⚠️ **THE COMMENT THAT RECORDS A COPY IS ALSO THE FIRST THING TO ROT**, because it cites the source
  it was copied from and nothing updates it when that source changes. Here it made two claims about
  the origin file and that file supported **neither**. Delete the copy and both claims go with it —
  do not rewrite them into a fresh claim (class 2).
- **Scanning heuristic:** grep for `copied rather than shared`, `duplicates`, `same pattern as`,
  `mirrors`. Each is a census entry nobody registered.

**Sibling.** Class 8 is the same seam from the other side: *consolidating* N copies dissolves the
population an audit asserts over. This is *creating* one, invisibly. Both say the population is a
moving object that the instrument's key does not track.

---

### 14. A forbidden-list check catches only the spellings someone anticipated

Asserting the **absence** of bad content is unbounded by construction: the next wording is not on the
list. The failure is quiet and it compounds — each review round respells the claim, the list is
widened to match, and the widening reads as progress. A reviewer acting adversarially will produce a
phrase no list contained, and every live predicate reports PASS.

- **Trigger:** you are enumerating forbidden words, phrases or patterns to police free text.
- **Procedure:** invert it — assert the **complete permitted output**, normalising only the genuinely
  nondeterministic fields (timings, ids, paths). A pin has nothing left to respell, and it turns a
  reword from a silent pass into a loud, deliberate update. Pin **every** branch: the one no arm
  checks is the one that regresses. Where a list must survive, treat it as the weaker half, say so,
  and mutation-test that half specifically.
- **Relation to class 2:** class 2 says a corrected claim is still a claim. This is its enforcement
  twin — a check that enumerates wrong answers inherits the same treadmill as the claim it guards.

### 15. A seam that outlives the window it observes leaks into whatever runs next

Process-global instrumentation — an installed probe, a counter, a gauge — is sound only while its
install window brackets **all** the work it counts. Uninstall mid-flight and a pair is stranded: an
entry is counted while its exit fires against a null hook, leaving a phantom that every later
consumer reads as real. The signature is an arm that **passes alone and fails in the suite**, or one
that only fails under a shuffled order.

- **Trigger:** you are installing or removing a process-global hook, or reasoning about when one is
  safe to remove.
- **Procedure:** bracket the seam by a **barrier**, not by hope. Two specific traps:
  - the entry hook's pointer may be **captured by value at submit time**, so it stays callable after
    the uninstall — uninstalling is not a barrier, and resetting a counter is not synchronisation;
  - a **bounded drain is an observer, not a barrier**. It returns when its budget expires, with work
    still outstanding. Only a join is a barrier.
  Prefer a **structural** guarantee over a timing one: declare the guard so that reverse destruction
  runs the joining object first. A structural ordering needs no mutation to license it, which matters
  because the timing version may be unreproducible with the forcing seams available.
- **Scanning heuristic:** grep for `install_`/`uninstall_` pairs not wrapped in a guard, and for a
  guard declared *after* the pool or context whose work it observes.

### 16. A disabled gate rots everything written to satisfy it, and the two gaps hide each other

A suppression, exemption or annotation written for a gate that is **off** is never exercised as a
claim. It decays with no symptom, because the only thing that would have contradicted it is the gate.
The dead gate and the dead opt-out are therefore the *same* blind spot, each concealing the other.
Turning the gate on does not merely surface the findings it was always meant to catch — it surfaces
every opt-out that quietly stopped working while nobody was looking.

**Reference instance: fixpp#439.** The gcc presets set `FIXPP_WERROR=OFF` from the first presets
commit. Fifteen deprecated-API uses across nine files were suppressed with

```c
#if defined(__clang__) || defined(__GNUC__)
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wdeprecated-declarations"
#endif
```

The **guard names `__GNUC__`**, so it claims to cover GCC. The **pragma is `#pragma clang
diagnostic`**, which GCC does not honour — and does not warn about, so there is no diagnostic about
the missing diagnostic. The suppression was inert on GCC for its entire life, and nothing noticed
because the one lane that could have noticed had `-Werror` off. The guard recorded an INTENT; the
pragma is the MECHANISM; only the mechanism executes. (The same flip also found a second, larger
rot in the same direction: `[[clang::lifetimebound]]`, which GCC reports under `-Wattributes` — a
DEFAULT-ON warning, so `-Wall` was never what stood between the tree and the gate. 92767 distinct
sites **as measured at #439**; the figure is a record of that measurement, not a property of the
tree — it is dominated by generated headers and moves with every regeneration.)

**Three instances, one flip, three different mechanisms — which is the point.** The same gate flip
also found `-Wno-macro-redefined` applied to every non-MSVC compiler in `tests/log/CMakeLists.txt`,
with a comment saying it was there *"so FIXPP_WERROR does not turn the expected redefinition into an
error"*. That is a **clang** spelling. GCC does not recognise it and accepts it silently — an unknown
`-Wno-*` is only ever reported when some other diagnostic fires — so the target could not build once
`-Werror` arrived. GCC itself printed the diagnosis (*"unrecognized command-line option
'-Wno-macro-redefined' may have been intended to silence earlier diagnostics"*), which nothing had
ever been in a position to read. So the class is not "someone wrote the wrong pragma": the rot
appeared in a **pragma**, in a **preprocessor guard**, and in a **build-system flag**, because the
common cause is the disabled gate, not the mechanism.

⚠️ **Prefer removing the CAUSE to suppressing the diagnostic, because a suppression is what rots.**
The redefinition fix is `-U` then `-D` rather than a second `-D` plus a silencer: then no
redefinition happens on any compiler and there is nothing to keep working. Where you do suppress,
verify the SUPPRESSED PROPERTY still holds — here, that the macro is still `3` afterwards and not
merely undefined, which a check for "the error went away" would have missed.

- **Trigger:** you are about to ENABLE a gate that has been off — a lane's `-Werror`, a sanitizer, a
  lint, a coverage floor — or you are writing an opt-out for a gate that is off on some platform.
- **Procedure:** budget for the rot rather than meeting it as a surprise. MEASURE before flipping:
  replay the lane's own compile/run commands with the gate on and enumerate what fails, instead of
  flipping and reading the CI log. Compile to `/dev/null`, not `-fsyntax-only` — a front-end-only run
  cannot see the optimiser-emitted diagnostics, which are exactly the compiler-specific ones a
  disabled lane accumulates. Then check each surviving opt-out **two-sided**: prove the suppressed
  site is silent AND that an unsuppressed sibling still fires, on *every* compiler the guard names.
- ⚠️ **Enabling the gate also invalidates the lane's compiler cache**, because the gate is a flag and
  a flag moves every command line. Check what asserts a cache HIT FLOOR before flipping: a floor will
  fire correctly on the deliberate re-seed and read as a failure of the change.
- **Sibling:** class 3 says a document may not record a RESULT. This is its executable form — a
  PREPROCESSOR CONDITION can record an intent it does not implement, and unlike a comment it looks
  like code that someone checked.

---

### 17. Trust keyed on a textual proxy admits whatever shares the proxy

A check decides "this is the thing I trust" by comparing a **derived or textual stand-in** — a
basename for a path, a path string for the directory it names, a name for an identity. Anything that
shares the stand-in without being the thing passes the check.

- **Trigger:** a trust, ownership or identity decision compares a value you *computed from* the
  thing (a suffix, a basename, a normalised string, a name), or treats "the text matches" as "it
  exists".
- **Procedure:** compare the full, normalised value, and state what the normalisation does and does
  not canonicalise. Where the decision needs the thing to be real, test that it is real (`-d`, a
  lookup), not that its name is right. Then write the alias explicitly as a test case — a different
  thing that shares the proxy — and require it to be refused.
- **Instance (PR #496, fixpp#490, Gate B rounds 2 and 3).** The pin was trusted when its basename
  equalled the branch, so `elsewhere/091-own` was trusted on `091-own`, and a legacy `specs/feature/x`
  on branch `x`. That was fixed to full-path identity, and the next round found the second layer:
  a foreign pin *naming* `specs/<branch>` was trusted though that directory did not exist, so a
  bundle-less branch resolved and `setup-plan.sh` would have created it. Each layer passed every arm
  written for the previous one; only a case built as an alias exposed it.
- ⚠️ **A name is still a proxy after the fix.** A recorded branch name identifies a branch by NAME, so a
  branch re-created under that name inherits the trust. That residue is disclosed, not closed —
  close it only if the name can be reused without deliberate intent.

**Sibling.** Class 13 is an instrument keyed on an identifier that misses a *copy*. This is a gate
keyed on an identifier that admits an *alias*. Same key, opposite direction.

## How to query the instances

The corpus is private and machine-local. From the parent repo:

```bash
research/G19-fix-fpml-iso20022/tools/lessons.py instrument zero clean
research/G19-fix-fpml-iso20022/tools/lessons.py citation line shift
```

⭐ **It is a LOOKUP, not a gate.** Nothing returned means *"no recorded lesson matched those words"* —
never *"there is no defect here"*. The corpus holds only what has already bitten someone.

⚠️ **There is deliberately no "antipattern checking" agent.** An agent that answers *"no antipattern
applies"* is a new instrument that fails toward clean — class 1, applied to the thing meant to police
class 1 — and nothing could tell whether it looked.
