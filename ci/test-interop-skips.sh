# Regression harness for ci/assert-interop-skips.py (fixpp#431).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The checker is what stands between the skipped cases and a
# green CI lane — a SKIP must not read as a PASS, and this is the instrument
# that enforces it. Per this repo's rule
# (feedback_verification_grep_must_be_proven_nonzero_on_the_unfixed_tree), an
# assertion nobody has seen fail is not evidence: every cell below drives a
# synthetic gtest-JSON fixture at the real script and checks BOTH the exit
# code and that the diagnostic names the right thing, not merely that it is
# non-zero (a checker that exits non-zero for the wrong reason is not a
# passing cell).
#
# Buildless: python3 + coreutils only, no ctest, no compiler, no real gtest
# binary. Every fixture is a hand-built gtest JSON report — the skipped-case
# fixtures carry the same leading `<file>:<line>\n` location line a real
# report does (write_json below), because the checker strips exactly that
# much before matching the reason, and a fixture without it cannot witness
# the strip being load-bearing.
#
# Run by the `ci-script-pins` job in tier1.yml, and locally with:
#   ci/test-interop-skips.sh

# entry whose message is `<file>:<line>\n<message>\n` — the real shape a gtest
# JSON report uses, location line then reason, which is what makes the
# checker's location-line strip a load-bearing thing for a fixture to prove,
