# Regression pin for tier 1's Python policy.
#
# HISTORY, because the target moved. #243/#251 wrote this to pin the
# sanitizer -> Conan-profile mapping of the `python-bindings` JOB, plus the
# `PY_RE` python-relevance filter in `gate-precheck`. #254 folded that job into
# the six `linux` matrix legs and deleted it, taking four of the six original
# assertions and five of the six mutants with it. What replaces them is not a
# narrowing: the same mapping now lives in ci/derive-python-sanitizer.sh and is
# pinned by DRIVING THE REAL SCRIPT, which is stronger than parsing YAML for it.
#
# A naive version of this pin would re-read the YAML to confirm the YAML —
# a tautology. These assertions are NOT that:
#
#   1. Derive-script behaviour, over an EXACT SET read from the workflow: the
#      six presets in the `linux` job's `strategy.matrix.preset` are read out of
#      tier1.yml and ci/derive-python-sanitizer.sh is EXECUTED on each, with all
#      three of its outputs (`sanitizer`, `rt_base`, `san_opts`) compared against
#      the expected table below.
#      ⚠️ **Precisely what is exact, corrected at Gate B round 1 (F3).** The set
#      equality holds between the MATRIX and this file's EXPECTED_DERIVE table:
#      a preset added to the matrix without a row here fails, and vice versa.
#      It does NOT enumerate the script's own accepted arms — adding a valid
#      `linux-clang-msan)` arm to the script while leaving it out of the matrix
#      still passes. That is untested-but-unreachable code, not a live
#      false-green (the workflow only ever calls the script with `matrix.preset`,
#      and that set IS pinned exactly), but the earlier wording claimed more than
#      it delivered. A `--list-presets` mode was considered and rejected: it adds
#      a surface to the production script to close a gap with no reachable defect.
#      Plus one unknown preset, asserting exit 1 rather than a defaulted `none`.
#   2+3. The four load-bearing steps of the `linux` job — derive, Configure, and
#      the two pytest steps — have their `run:` blocks compared VERBATIM against
#      canonical text held in this file, plus their `id:`/`if:` fields, which are
#      not part of `run:`. This is a GOLDEN, adopted at Gate B round 3b after the
#      previous content-matching form was defeated nine times; the full reasoning,
#      the cost, and what the comparison is and is not, are documented at the
#      EXPECTED_*_RUN block below. Read that before touching this area.
#      ⚠️ `san_opts` is the consumer that matters most — a UBSan leg that loses
#      `halt_on_error=1` runs, finds, prints, and exits 0 (R2-P2-3).
#   6. `ci-script-pins` invokes all four `ci/` harnesses. A harness that is green
#      when run but never runs has no coverage at all (round 3b finding 5).
#   4. `PY_RE` case table: the literal is extracted from the `gate-precheck`
#      step (not duplicated here, so this pin cannot pass against a stale
#      copy) and evaluated with `grep -E` against a fixed positive/negative
#      path list — genuinely behavioural, not a re-statement of the pattern.
#      ⚠️ UNCHANGED BY #254 and deliberately so: narrowing PY_RE now that it
#      gates the wheel jobs alone is #253's, not this change's (NG-4).
#   5. `tier1-required`'s `needs:` exact-set census: SEVEN job names since #254
#      (was eight; `python-bindings` removed). This is the assertion that guards
#      the trap — the `result` of a job not in `needs:` is the EMPTY STRING,
#      which is neither `success` nor `skipped`, so a half-applied deletion reds
#      the required check on every non-release run.
#
# EVERY assertion has at least one mutant driven through this same script via a
# MUTATED COPY of tier1.yml or of the derive script, so the pin proves it can
# fail before it is trusted to pass (feedback_verification_grep_must_be_proven_
# nonzero_on_the_unfixed_tree). See run_mutant_checks() below.
#
# ⚠️ M4 IS NEW AND ITS ABSENCE WAS A REAL HOLE. Assertion 5 (the `needs:`
# census) shipped in #251 with NO mutant — it had never been proven RED. #254
# re-bases it from eight names to seven, and re-basing a never-tested assertion
# under a new number is how an untested check acquires false credibility.
#
# ⚠️ The declared mutant count is asserted against the number that actually ran
# (see MUTANTS_DECLARED). PR #251's own review loop shipped a summary claiming
# five mutants where six ran; the remedy for that is a machine check, not a
# human eyeball.
#
# ⚠️ ACCEPTED BRITTLENESS — WAIVED AT GATE B ROUND 2 (finding 6a, P3), AND
# GENERALIZED AT ROUND 3b. DO NOT "FIX" THIS BY LOOSENING ANYTHING.
#
# The four pinned steps match their canonical text exactly, so a purely cosmetic
# edit to any of them reds this pin. That was the accepted trade at round 2 for
# one assertion (`readonly RT_BASE=…` is semantically identical and RED — measured
# as X4), and round 3b made it the whole design. The reasoning is unchanged and
# now much stronger:
#
#   * a false RED here is LOUD, self-announcing, and fixed in one place by whoever
#     trips it — the person who edited the step is the person reading the diff the
#     failure prints;
#   * every false-green this pin has ever had — nine of them, measured across
#     three gate rounds — came from tolerating text that was not the text that
#     decides. Loosening is a move back toward exactly that.
#
# The one loosening that IS present is principled and proven: the comparison is
# against the YAML-PARSED value, so a folded scalar re-wrapped at different
# columns is the same string and stays GREEN. M28 is the positive control for it,
# and it is what distinguishes this golden from a file hash.
#
# ══ WHAT THIS PIN PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT ══════════════════════════════
#
# Written at Gate B round 9, after eight rounds in which each round found the
# same class one layer further out. Stating the boundary is what ends that: an
# unbounded promise generates unbounded findings, and every one of them looks
# real because the promise really was too big.
#
# PROVES (all machine-checked, each with at least one mutant proven RED for its
# own reason — see run_mutant_checks):
#   * the derive script's behaviour, EXECUTED over the exact preset set read from
#     the matrix, plus fail-closed on an unknown preset;
#   * the four load-bearing `linux` steps — derive, Configure, and both pytest
#     steps — compared VERBATIM against canonical blocks held here;
#   * exact key sets at STEP, JOB, MATRIX and WORKFLOW level, so any added key
#     (`continue-on-error`, `shell`, `container`, `defaults`, `exclude`, …) reds
#     without anyone having to have thought of it;
#   * the two pytest steps' `env:` blocks as whole objects;
#   * the ordered list of `uses:` step OBJECTS — references AND their `with:`
#     inputs, so `checkout` with `ref: main` cannot silently test the wrong tree;
#   * a fail-closed census of steps MENTIONING an environment/path file;
#   * `PY_RE`'s behaviour over a fixed case table, and `tier1-required`'s
#     `needs:` as an exact set;
#   * that every `ci/` harness is actually invoked by `ci-script-pins`.
#
# DOES NOT PROVE, deliberately and by recorded decision (Gate B rounds 5-8):
#   * a file spelling ASSEMBLED at runtime — deliberate obfuscation, not an edit;
#   * that a mutable action reference (`…@main`) returns the same remote content
#     — this pins what the workflow ASKS FOR, not what the registry returns;
#   * the runner substrate: labels, self-hosted images, preinstalled tooling;
#   * `services:`, or arbitrary preceding filesystem state — a pre-pytest step
#     that drops a `conftest.py`, writes a `pytest.ini` or pip-installs a plugin
#     changes the outcome without naming anything this pin watches;
#   * anything about what the six legs ACTUALLY DO at runtime. This is a policy
#     pin over tracked workflow text. The runtime gates are the two ctest install
#     witnesses and pytest's own exit status.
#
# ⚠️ If you are here because a review found something outside the second list,
# fix it. If it is INSIDE the second list, the answer is not a new census — it is
# that this pin does not promise that. Say so and close the finding.
#
# Hermetic: reads tracked files only. No build, no Conan, no network, no `nm`.
# It DOES hard-require an importable PyYAML on the caller's `python3` (see
# below) — providing that is the caller's responsibility, not this script's.

# expanding the matrix — `include`/`exclude` are the only two keys that can
# change the instantiation, and a set comparison also covers anything added later.
linux_matrix_keys = sorted(str(k) for k in linux_job["strategy"]["matrix"].keys())

# ⚠️ Round 4 finding 3. Nothing in `run:` stops a PRECEDING step from changing
# what the pinned steps execute. The measured escape was one unnamed step,
# `run: echo 'PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--collect-only' >> "$GITHUB_ENV"`, which collides
# with no pinned name and adds no pytest mention, yet turns both golden commands
# into collection-only runs that exit 0.
#
# Three surfaces carry that, and each is censused rather than parsed:
#   * writes to $GITHUB_ENV / $GITHUB_PATH from any step in the job (measured: ZERO today)
#   * `uses:` steps, which can do the same from inside a composite action
#   * the job-level `env:` and `defaults:`
# ⚠️ COUNT, not names, and the difference was a live false-green (round 5
# finding 1). This stored step NAMES and the assertion compared `join(",")` — so
# ONE UNNAMED writer produced `[""]`, which joins to the empty string and read as
# ZERO writers. Turning an existing named step into an unnamed one therefore
# defeated the writer census AND the step count at once. Names are kept for the
# message only; the assertion is over the LENGTH.
#
# ⚠️ `${{ github.env }}` and `${{ github.path }}` are GitHub's OFFICIAL context
# properties for the same two files — not obfuscation. A census that recognizes
# only the `$GITHUB_ENV` spelling excludes a documented alias, which is a gap
# rather than an accepted threat-model boundary (the concession for *computed*
# paths stands; excluding official spellings does not).
# ⚠️ Round 6 finding 2: a fixed list of spellings was still short. Actions
# expressions support BOTH property dereference and INDEX syntax, so
# `${{ github['env'] }}` and `${{ github["env"] }}` name the same file as
# `${{ github.env }}` and were not matched. Both forms, with the whitespace
# Actions permits, are now one regex.
#
# The stated boundary, unchanged and still honest: this covers the DOCUMENTED
# spellings of the environment/path files. A path assembled at runtime
# (`F=$GITHUB_"ENV"`, a variable holding it, a helper script) is deliberate
# obfuscation and out of the tracked-workflow, non-obfuscating threat model.
# Excluding documented spellings would be a gap; excluding constructed ones is a
# boundary. Round 5 drew that line and round 6 moved another spelling across it.
# ⚠️ THIS CENSUS MATCHES *MENTIONS*, NOT WRITES, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Read
# this before "tightening" it — the tightening has already been tried and it was
# the defect.
#
# Round 7 flagged (P3) that matching the NAME anywhere produced a false RED on a
# harmless `echo 'github.path is documented by Actions'`. The fix required a
# redirection or `tee` before the spelling. Round 8 then measured what that
# bought: `cp /etc/hostname "$GITHUB_ENV"` writes the file and matches no
# redirection, so it passed the whole harness. `mv`, `install`, `dd of=`,
# `sed -i` and `python3 -c` are the same shape.
#
# ⇒ The round-7 "fix" WAS round-8's P1, in its entirety. Enumerating the ways a
# shell can write a file is the interpret-the-shell trap that this pin abandoned
# at round 3b, re-entered through a cosmetic finding.
#
# An over-approximation that FAILS CLOSED is the correct shape here. A step that
# merely names an environment file is something a human should look at; the false
# RED costs one line — pin the legitimate mention here, by name, in the same
# commit that introduces it. Measured at HEAD: ZERO steps mention any spelling,
# so the census needs no allowlist today.
#
# The scan is over the SERIALIZED WHOLE STEP OBJECT, not `run:` alone, so `env:`,
# `with:` and `if:` are in scope too — that closes the `${{ env.FOO }}`
# indirection (a step `env:` holding `${{ github.env }}`, written through `$FOO`)
# without a special case for it.
#
# Still out of scope, and stated rather than implied: a spelling ASSEMBLED at
# runtime. That is deliberate obfuscation, not an ordinary edit.

# ── 2 + 3: the four load-bearing steps, pinned as CANONICAL BLOCKS ──────────
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS A GOLDEN, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. Read this before changing it.
#
# Rounds 1-3b of Gate B found ONE class — an assertion satisfied by text that is
# not the text that decides — NINE times in this file, four of them inside the fix
# for the previous one. Each fix taught the pin to interpret one more piece of
# shell, and the next round found a construct it did not model:
#
#   round 1   the whole JOB was in scope        -> scope to the step
#   round 2   `first(… contains …)` picked a decoy step; the FIRST occurrence was
#             read instead of the effective one
#   round 3   the step's RAW text was read after selecting on its effective text;
#             a diagnostic `echo` carried the flag; `head -1` of the invocations;
#             `echo` MENTIONING pytest; the same under a correct `env` prefix
#   round 3b  heredoc data; `if false` blocks; `#` inside a QUOTED STRING (which
#             the stripper removed, HIDING a real unprefixed invocation — the
#             stripper could make the check laxer, not stricter, contrary to what
#             its own comment claimed); `pytest … | true`; `pytest … &`;
#             `export RT_BASE=asan`; `printf -v RT_BASE`; `unset RT`
#
# The pin was losing an arms race it could only win by becoming a shell
# interpreter. It is not one, and it will not become one.
#
# ⇒ The four steps whose text decides whether the six legs are correct are now
# compared VERBATIM against expected blocks held here. No comment stripping, no
# continuation joining, no invocation regexes, no notion of what shell means.
#
# The soundness argument is exactly one sentence: ANY change to these blocks REDS.
# `pytest … | true` is not defeated because the pin understands pipelines — it is
# defeated because the text differs. That is a complete argument where the
# interpretive one never was, and it is why ~280 lines of parsing were DELETED
# rather than left beside this as a "defence in depth" a later reader could
# reconstruct the weak form from.
#
# ⚠️ WHAT IS COMPARED IS THE YAML TEXT, NOT WHAT RAN. `${{ … }}` interpolations
# are expanded by Actions before the shell sees them; the blocks below therefore
# contain the interpolations, un-expanded, and that is correct — the property
# being pinned is "the derived value is what this step consumes". Do not "fix"
# this by trying to compare against an expanded command.
#
# ⚠️ COST, ACCEPTED KNOWINGLY, and consistent with the round-2 waiver of finding
# 6a: any edit to these four steps reds this pin, including a purely cosmetic one.
# That is the intended workflow — the failure message prints a unified diff and
# names this block as the place to update. Update it deliberately, having read
# what changed. A reflow-only edit is proven GREEN by M12; a one-character change
# to a flag or to the `env` prefix is proven RED by M13/M14.
#
# ⚠️ SELECTED BY `name:`, NEVER BY CONTENT. Selecting a golden-compared step by
# its own text would be circular, and `name:` is not the text under attack. A
# decoy would need a duplicate name, which the exactly-one rule below catches.
#
# NOT covered here, deliberately: `if:` on the two pytest steps IS part of the
# golden set (asserted separately below, exactly), and the derive/Configure steps
# are asserted to carry NO `if:` at all — a step that cannot run is not a step
# that does the work (round 3b finding 5, applied to this job as well as to
# `ci-script-pins`).

# The expected `run:` text of each load-bearing step, keyed by its exact `name:`.
# Trailing newlines are normalized away on both sides; nothing else is.

  # 30 -> 31 (#266): the `linux` job gained `Peak memory (packaging tier)`, the

  #
  # THE DELIBERATE LOOK THIS PIN DEMANDS, done rather than asserted. The added
  # step sits before the pytest pair, so the question is whether it can change
  # what they execute:
  #   * it writes NO environment — `ci/peak-memory-report.sh` writes only
  #     $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY and stdout, never $GITHUB_ENV or $GITHUB_PATH
  #     (that is separately policed by the env-writer census, M34);
  #   * its `env:` is step-level (`TEST_OUTCOME`) and does not outlive it;
  #   * it is `continue-on-error: true` AND the script always exits 0, so it
  #     cannot fail the job out from under the python steps;
  #   * it has no `id` that anything references, collides with no pinned step
  #     name, and mentions no pytest token.
  # Conclusion: it cannot reach the pytest pair.
  #
  # 31 -> 32 (#252): the `linux` job gained `Assert the dependency closure is
  # instrumented (#252)`, which runs `ci/assert-sanitized-deps.sh` immediately
  # after `Conan install`.
  #
  # THE DELIBERATE LOOK, again done rather than asserted. This step also sits
  # before the pytest pair:
  #   * it writes NO environment — the script's only outputs are stdout and
  #     `::error::` on stderr; it touches neither $GITHUB_ENV nor $GITHUB_PATH
  #     (M34's env-writer census polices that independently);
  #   * it carries no step-level `env:` at all;
  #   * it has no `id` that anything references, collides with no pinned step
  #     name, and mentions no pytest token;
  #   * it READS the tree only — `find` + `nm` over the Conan package folders —
  #     so it cannot alter what the python steps later build or import.
  #   * ⚠️ it is NOT `continue-on-error`, unlike the #266 step above, so unlike
  #     that one it CAN fail the job before the pytest pair runs. That is
  #     deliberate and is the whole point (#252 is a fail-closed gate on the
  #     dependency closure), but it is the one property this step does not share
  #     with its predecessor, and stating it is cheaper than rediscovering it: a
  #     RED here means the python legs never run, and their absence on such a run
  #     is expected rather than a second defect.

# `ci/test-ccache-scripts.sh` drives the ccache SCRIPTS, and nothing anywhere
# inspected the `python-wheel-build` JOB's environment or step order — the
# exact seam Codex's flagship silent mutant lives on (drop `CONAN_HOME` from
# the container's `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT` and every ccache-side assertion still
# passes; only the dependency closure quietly rebuilds from source every run).
#
# The container does not inherit the runner's environment,
# so CONAN_HOME and the four CCACHE_* vars reach the compile ONLY through this
# one string. YAML keeps only the LAST of two same-named mapping keys rather
# than erroring, so a second `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT:` is the same silent-drop shape
# under a different edit — both are asserted via the same "does the single
# resolved value carry all five" check, which is what YAML parsing can see.
# opus_pr270_2_triage.md R2-F1. The key-set + per-substring checks this used
# to be were each satisfiable by a value the OTHER side of a two-sided contract
# does not have: `case "$val" in *"CONAN_HOME="*)` matches inside
# `XCONAN_HOME=/tmp` (Codex's flagship escape — a typo'd name that still
# contains every pinned substring), and neither check compares a VALUE against
# anything, so a wrong path (`CONAN_HOME=/tmp`), a swap of the two paths, or a
# rename of the mount TARGET in the sibling `CIBW_CONTAINER_ENGINE` (same step)
# all leave this pin green while the container silently loses its
# Conan/ccache wiring.
#
# Exact whole-map equality subsumes the key-set check (so that check is DELETED
# here, not kept alongside — two assertions for one property is how the weaker
# one survives a later simplification, per the if:-emptiness check removed above) and is strictly
# stronger than a parsed-assignment map compared as a mount-target SET: a set
# comparison is blind to a swap (`CONAN_HOME=/host-ccache
# CCACHE_DIR=/host-conan2` produces the identical target set), because the
# PAIRING is the property and only string equality on the whole value pins a
# pairing without extra parsing code. It also pins the mount SOURCE
# (`${{ env.CCACHE_DIR }}`) against a respelling to a literal path — the first
# direct pin of the one-spelling invariant `fc7a4ae3` exists to establish.
#
# Not too brittle: this file already pins `linux_job_env` as an exact map
# including "CCACHE_COMPRESSLEVEL":"5", with a written rationale
# (`linux_step_count`, above) that a legitimate bump is a deliberate act priced
# at one line in the same commit. Loosening CCACHE_MAXSIZE/CCACHE_COMPRESSLEVEL

  # ── RETIRED AT GATE B ROUND 3b, WITH THE REASON ─────────────────────────────
  #
  # Fourteen mutants were DELETED here, not left declared: M8, M9, M10, M12, M13,
  # M16, M17, M18, M19, M20, M22, M23, M24, M25.
  #
  # Every one of them mutated the `run:` text of a step that is now compared
  # VERBATIM against a canonical block (see the EXPECTED_*_RUN section above), so
  # every one of them now reds with the same message — "this block does not match"
  # — and none of them distinguishes anything the four golden-coverage mutants
  # below do not. Keeping twenty mutants that all exercise one string comparison
  # would report coverage this suite does not have, which is the exact failure
  # MUTANTS_DECLARED exists to prevent.
  #
  # They are recorded here rather than silently dropped because each one is a
  # MEASURED false-green from rounds 1-3b, and the reason each is safe to retire
  # is that the golden subsumes it — not that it stopped mattering:
  #
  #   derive step run:      M12 (`#` comment), M24 (`;#`), M25 (same-step echo)
  #   Configure run:        M13 (decoy + flag deleted), M18 (`#` comment),
  #                         M20 (diagnostic echo)
  #   sanitizer pytest run: M8, M9, M10 (dead echoes), M16 (shadowed RT_BASE),
  #                         M17 (*SAN_OPTIONS after the interpolation),
  #                         M19 (decoy prefixed warm-up), M22 (echo under a
  #                         correct env prefix), M23 (dead if-false branch)
  #
  # ⚠️ If the golden is ever weakened back into content matching, these must come
  # back. That is the tripwire: the golden is load-bearing for fourteen recorded
  # false-greens, and the count below drops from 27 to 14 BECAUSE the instrument
  # got stronger, not because coverage was traded away.
