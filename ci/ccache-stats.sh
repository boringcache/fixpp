#   hit-floor           — OPTIONAL integer percent. Omitted = no floor.
#                         Which callers pass one is a property of the
#                         workflows, not of this file; re-derive with
#                         `grep -rn 'ccache-stats.sh' .github/workflows/`.
#                         A caller that CANNOT supply argument 2 must not pass
#                         a floor — see the gate note in the opt-in block.
#
# ── WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHAT IS ONLY REPORTED ──────────────────────────────
#
# ASSERTED: that ccache was reached at all. Zero cacheable calls after a
# SUCCESSFUL build means the launcher never took effect, and the whole change is
# then a no-op that reports green — the exact ran-exited-0-measured-nothing
# shape this repo keeps paying for.
#
# ⚠️ THE HIT RATE IS REPORTED BY DEFAULT AND ASSERTED ONLY ON OPT-IN. There is
# no floor unless a caller passes one (#299 turned it on for the lanes that can
# supply a restore disposition). The default stays report-only because the first
# run after a compiler bump is legitimately 0 %, and a cold run must not be red.
#
# The evidence for #240 is the PAIR (`restore HIT` AND a high hit rate): a HIT
# with 0 % is green under the DEFAULT instrument BY DESIGN and is the change
# failing, not passing. The opt-in floor at the end of this file is what turns
# that pair from a sentence addressed to a human into a check — but ONLY for a
# caller that can supply argument 2. A floor without a restore disposition is
# inert by construction, which would reproduce the defect rather than fix it.
#
# ⚠️ Zero cacheable calls does NOT by itself prove the launcher was unwired.
# ccache may have run and classified every invocation as uncacheable, or no
# compile edge may have run at all. This script therefore REPORTS the open causes
# and the uncacheable counters that discriminate between them, rather than
# asserting one. (Same correction as PR #247's finding G2.)
#
# ⚠️ `set -uo pipefail` WITHOUT `-e` — see restore-ccache.sh's header. Every
# failure path below is explicitly dispositioned instead.

# ── Published so the seed step can skip republishing an UNCHANGED cache ───────
#
# ⚠️ GATED ON `local_storage_write`, NOT `cache_miss` — `cache_miss == 0` does
# NOT prove ccache wrote no new entry. Measured against real ccache 4.9.1: a
# same-line-count edit to a header or `.cpp` (comment/whitespace only) produces
# `direct_cache_miss=1, preprocessed_cache_hit=1, cache_miss=0` while ccache
# still updates its on-disk manifest — an ordinary shape in a comment-dense
# repo, needing no special env var. The old gate withheld a genuinely-changed
# cache on exactly that push. `local_storage_write` increments on any write to
# CCACHE_DIR and is what actually answers "does the tag already hold this
# content" — re-archiving ~2 GB and re-uploading it when it does accomplishes
# nothing except orphaning another untagged version for the pruner to reclaim.
#
# ⚠️ EMITTED HERE, BEFORE THE LIVENESS CHECK BELOW, ON PURPOSE. The value is
# wanted even on the paths that end in `exit 1`, and computing it after a branch
# that can exit is how an output silently goes missing.
#
# ⚠️ AN EMPTY `changed` SATISFIES THE CONSUMER'S `!= '0'`. Whether that
# publishes depends on WHY it read empty. Every path above this line that
# would leave it unset exits 1 first, so an empty read caused by THIS SCRIPT
# failing is withheld from publishing only while the caller ALSO fails the
# job on that exit (no `continue-on-error`) and the seed step's implicit
# `success()` gates on it. An empty read caused by the CONSUMER naming an
# output this script does not emit is a different failure: the statistics
# step still succeeds, and the seed publishes — ci/test-ccache-scripts.sh's
# `stats/output-name` cell guards that drift for tier3. Re-check both the
# caller's step attributes and the output name it reads before relying on
# this at a new call site.
#
# ⚠️ `changed` ALONE IS SUFFICIENT — do not add `&& restore == 'hit'`. A restore
# MISS with zero writes would mean no compile ran at all, and that case cannot
# reach the seed: the liveness check below exits 1 on it, which fails the job and
# skips every later step. Adding the conjunct would look safer while guarding a
# path that is already closed, and would then also skip the legitimate
# cold-seed case if the reasoning behind it ever drifted.
#
# `misses` is ALSO still emitted, alongside `changed` — not because it has a
# consumer of its own (after this fix, nothing reads the step output; the Job
# Summary table below reads the shell variable `$miss` directly, not
# `outputs.misses`), but because three existing regression-pin assertions read
# that exact output name and the line costs nothing to keep. Only `changed` is
# what the publish guard reads now.

# floor is wrong here for the same reason the liveness check is not a rate
# check: a legitimate warm run can be well down after a large refactor or a
# codegen change. 10 % is set to catch the PATHOLOGICAL signature — the tag was
# pulled but almost nothing in it matched, i.e. compiler, flag or path drift —
# without firing on ordinary churn. Tighten only once a warm baseline exists,
# which is the same discipline the missing rate floor follows.

# ── OPT-IN FATAL FLOOR, GATED ON A RESTORE HIT (#259) ────────────────────────
#
# The warning above is the right default: it must not redden lanes whose warm
# rate legitimately varies. But a warning is only as good as someone reading it,
# and #241 is on record staying open precisely because "a HIT at 0 % is green by
# design" — an acceptance criterion written as prose that no instrument enforces.
# A lane that has a warm baseline can opt into having that criterion CHECKED.
#
# ⚠️ GATED ON `RESTORE == true`, and that gate is the whole design. The seeding
# run — the first push:main after this lands — legitimately reports 0 % because
# nothing was restored, and a floor that reddened it would make the change look
# broken at the exact moment it is working. PR runs that MISS are equally exempt.
# Only "we pulled a cache AND it did not match" is fatal, which is the pair the
# acceptance criterion actually names.
#
# Not a default: turning this on for a lane is a claim that the lane HAS a warm
# baseline. Making that claim for a lane whose baseline nobody has measured
# would be the same unmeasured assertion this file keeps refusing to make.
#
# ⚠️ AND IT IS A CLAIM THE LANE CAN SUPPLY ARGUMENT 2. A caller that passes an
# empty restore disposition can never reach the fatal branch below, so a floor
# there is decorative — it would report "NOT evaluated" every run while looking
# enforced in the diff. Any lane restoring through an action that exposes no
# hit output is in that position and must NOT be given a floor.
