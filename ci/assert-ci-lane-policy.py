"""Assert the CI lane invariants this repo's mechanisms depend on (#300, #213).

    ci/assert-ci-lane-policy.py [<repo root>]

WHY THIS EXISTS

Two mechanisms landed whose CORRECTNESS TODAY was verified once, by hand, and
then pinned by nothing. A hostile review named both, and named them precisely:
the trees were complete, but "that completeness is nevertheless an unpinned
result". This repo's rule is that a result which nothing re-derives goes stale
silently — so each is turned into a check.

  1. #300 — every apt-backed install goes through ci/apt-guard.sh.
     The harness ci/test-apt-guard.sh tests the WRAPPER. It never looks at the
     callers, so adding one bare `sudo apt-get install ...` or one bare
     `llvm.sh <N> all` leaves every apt cell green while the "every apt-backed
     install is bounded" claim quietly becomes false. That is the same
     dead-call-site shape #299 exists to prevent, one layer out.

  2. #267 — the parallelism campaign stays on `workflow_dispatch`.
     `.github/workflows/parallelism-measure.yml` runs each named lane's suite
     THREE times, and on the slowest lane a single pass is most of an hour. One
     `push:` or `pull_request:` key added to its trigger block — by a copy-paste
     from another workflow, or by someone "making it run automatically" —
     multiplies the repo's CI bill without anything going red to say so. It is
     the one workflow here whose cost makes its TRIGGER a correctness property,
     and "we all know not to" is not a mechanism.

  3. #213 — the fuzz corpora are actually replayed somewhere.
     The corpus replays and their zero-registration FATAL_ERROR all live under
     `if(FIXPP_BUILD_FUZZ)`. Flipping the asan preset's value ON -> OFF does not
     trip any of them: the targets, the registrations and the guard simply stop
     being evaluated, and the lane returns to replaying zero seeds with every
     script gate still green. The guard cannot guard its own enabling flag.

  4. #411 Gate B r1 F4 (parallelism-measure half) — the campaign's `linux` and
     `libcxx` jobs each restore Tier 1's GHCR compiler cache, restore-only,
     never publishing. `ci/test-tier1-python-policy.sh` only reads tier1.yml,
     so nothing pinned this workflow's restore steps at all: deleting one,
     reordering it after `Conan install`, or adding a seed call all left every
     existing check green.

EXIT
  0  every invariant holds
  1  at least one violated (each named, with the file that breaks it)
  2  the check could not run, or scanned nothing — an empty scan is an
     instrument failure here, not a pass
