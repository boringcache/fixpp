# CI-side (#411): shrink a leg's ccache store to what THIS run used, so the
# archive ci/seed-ccache.sh publishes afterwards holds what this run touched
# up to the seed. Objects compiled after it — any nested sub-build a later
# test step runs — are not published, and recompile on each run; a caller that
# seeds before its test steps accepts that trade-off deliberately (see the
# caller's own seed-placement comment).
#
#   ci/trim-ccache-to-run.sh <label>
#
#   label — the preset (e.g. linux-clang-debug). Used only to label this run's
#           disposition line — this script calls no API and does not need it
#           to find anything.
#   env   — CCACHE_DIR.
#
# ── WHY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A store only ever GROWS to its `max-size`: objects from earlier commits stay
# until ccache's own cleanup, so a leg's store reads as "full" whether or not
# the build still uses what is in it. `max-size` is a ceiling, not a measure of
# need — lowering it below the live set is the 500 MB thrash the workflow
# comment records.
#
# This step answers that without guessing a size: evict every cache file this
# run did not touch. The caller runs it after the build and BEFORE the seed
# step, so the trimmed store is what gets published.
#
# History: Tier 1 first ran this against `hendrikmuhs/ccache-action` entries in
# the shared Actions cache (PR #460). An earlier version there also deleted the
# superseded entry before the action had saved its replacement (Gate B round 1,
# F1) and was removed. Measured on run 35113493891, the trim alone did not bring
# two generations under the 10 GB cap, so the legs moved to GHCR.
#
# ── WHICH FILES THIS RUN TOUCHED ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# ci/restore-ccache.sh runs `ccache --zero-stats` at the end of its restore, so
# the counters' `stats_zeroed_timestamp` is the restore time. ccache refreshes a
# file's mtime on every hit, and a restored file keeps the mtime it was
# archived with, so `--evict-older-than <now - zeroed>` keeps exactly the files
# hit or written since the restore. This step relies on the implicit
# `success()` GitHub Actions applies to a status-function-free `if:` — it
# excludes a failed build only while Build carries no `continue-on-error`,
# which the caller's policy test (ci/test-tier1-python-policy.sh,
# assert_trim_wiring) pins as part of Build's key set.
#
# Fail direction: anything that makes the timestamp unreadable, suggests the
# counters were zeroed AFTER the build (zero calls counted), or puts the
# zeroed timestamp at or after now (clock stepped back, or an unreadable
# clock reading), SKIPS eviction. A skipped eviction publishes the old superset —
# larger, never colder.
#
# Residual (disclosed, not guarded): a backward clock step that leaves
# `now > zeroed` can still evict files touched during the stepped-back
# window. The wall clock cannot detect this; there is no heuristic for it.
#
# ── WHAT NEVER REDDENS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A compiler cache that is down must never redden a lane whose build and tests
# passed: every ccache failure is a `::warning::` and exit 0. Only a WIRING
# error (missing argument or environment) exits non-zero, because a mis-wired
# call would otherwise no-op on every run while looking green.
#
# Verify on any Tier 1 run (a PR run's trimmed store is not published): this
# step's `ccache-evict:` line (MiB before -> after), then the seed step's
# archive size on a push to main.
#
# ⚠️ `set -uo pipefail` WITHOUT `-e` — every failure path is dispositioned.
