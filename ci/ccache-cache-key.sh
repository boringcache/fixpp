# Single source of truth for the fixpp-ccache OCI tag (Tier 3, #240).
#
# SOURCED (not executed) by BOTH seed-ccache.sh and restore-ccache.sh, for the
# same reason ci/sccache-cache-key.sh and ci/conan-cache-key.sh exist: a key the
# two sides compute DIFFERENTLY is silently a permanent MISS, and a permanent
# MISS on a compiler cache is indistinguishable from "ccache didn't help" —
# which is the exact conclusion #240 is trying to change.
#
# No `set` here on purpose: this is sourced, and a library must not mutate the
# caller's shell options.
#
# ── WHY THE TAG IS COARSE (preset + compiler identity) AND NOT CONTENT-HASHED ─
#
# Identical reasoning to ci/sccache-cache-key.sh, and it is worth restating
# because the Conan tag next door does the opposite. The Conan tag hashes
# conanfile.py + the profile because a Conan package is opaque: a wrong HIT
# relinks against a foreign STL, which is what forced the 2026-07-19 revert
# (main 327d7665). ccache has no such failure mode. Its own entry hash covers
# the compiler (CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK=content is set job-wide in
# tier3-libcxx.yml), the full argument list and the preprocessed source, so a
# stale entry cannot be mistakenly reused — it simply does not match and the TU
# recompiles.
#
# That inverts the design goal. A content-hashed tag would MISS on every commit
# that touches the source, i.e. exactly the commits this cache exists to speed
# up. The tag therefore has to be as STABLE as possible so a PR leg can pull
# what main last published; ccache then decides, per TU, what still applies.
#
# ── WHY THE COMPILER IDENTITY IS STILL IN THE TAG ────────────────────────────
#
# Not for correctness — for cost, and for one diagnostic.
#
# COST: after an apt.llvm.org rebuild, EVERY entry in a cache built by the old
# clang misses INTERNALLY (the compiler is part of ccache's hash under
# `compilercheck=content`), so restoring it downloads ~2 GB to achieve nothing.
# Folding the compiler's self-reported identity into the tag converts that slow
# useless HIT into a fast MISS, and the next push:main / dispatch republishes
# under the new tag.
#
# DIAGNOSTIC: `llvm.sh 22` can silently fall back to an earlier clang major.
# With one rolling tag that shows up as a 0 % hit rate and nothing else — a
# symptom this repo has already paid for once. With the compiler in the tag it
# shows up as a NEW TAG in the GHCR listing, which is a fact rather than an
# inference.
#
# ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* IN THE TAG ────────────────────────────────────
#
# The ccache version. ccache versions its own on-disk entry format and ignores
# what it cannot read, so a version bump degrades to internal misses that heal
# on the next seed — the same shape as any other miss, and not worth a tag
# dimension whose only effect would be to discard a still-usable cache whenever
# the runner image bumps a package.

# ccache_preset_family <preset>
#
# Prints the compiler family a host preset's tag is minted and matched under:
# `gcc` when the preset name carries a `gcc` segment, otherwise `clang`.
#
# ⚠️ READ FROM THE PRESET NAME, AND THAT IS A CONDITION, NOT A PROBE. The pruner's
# `ccache_tag_regex` must stay pure string work (see its header), so the family
# cannot come from `--version` or CMakePresets.json there. Both the minter and the
# matcher call THIS function, so they cannot disagree about the family. The minter
# additionally refuses a banner that contradicts it (see ccache_cache_key): the
# family LABEL a tag carries must not contradict the compiler that actually built
# it, or the tag would misreport its own diagnostic.

# an unidentifiable toolset is a SAFETY failure and seed ABORTS. Here it is only
# an efficiency question, so both sides degrade to "no cache this run" — never
# fatal, because a compiler cache that is down must never redden a lane whose

# ccache_lane_is_container <lane>
#
# The lanes whose compiler lives INSIDE a pinned container image. Enumerated in

# routes to the matching minter and rejects any lane/argument-shape mismatch)
# and by the matcher further down (ccache_tag_regex), because those two must
# never disagree about which grammar a lane uses.
# ⚠️ BOTH FORMS ARE ACCEPTED, AND THE BARE ONE IS NOT LEGACY CRUFT.
#
# The live lane carries the wheel's ABI tag (`wheel-manylinux228-cp312`) because
# that tag is part of the build path and therefore part of the cache identity —
# see ci/wheel-ccache-ident.sh for the measurement that forced it.
#
# The bare `wheel-manylinux228` stays enumerated so a prune CAN still be built
# for tags minted before the ABI tag was folded in. Dropping it would not delete
# those tags; it would make them unrecognisable, so they would accumulate
# forever with no `prune: PENDING` and no error — the silent-skip failure this
# enumeration exists to prevent. Remove it only once the old tags are reaped.
#
# ⚠️ THIS ENABLES A MANUAL PRUNE; IT DOES NOT MAKE ONE HAPPEN. Do not read the
# line above as "the old tags will be cleaned up". The workflow prunes exactly
# the lane it just SEEDED, and `ccache_tag_regex` is per-lane and anchored, so
# `^ccache-wheel-manylinux228-cp312-[0-9a-f]{8}$` does not match
# `ccache-wheel-manylinux228-012f4a50`. Nothing automatic will ever look at the
# pre-ABI-tag versions again. Reaping them is a deliberate act:
#
#     DRY_RUN=1 ci/prune-ccache.sh wheel-manylinux228 ''   # list, delete nothing
#     ci/prune-ccache.sh wheel-manylinux228 ''             # needs delete:packages

# Returns 1 if the lane or the image reference is unusable.
#
# ── WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM ccache_cache_key ─────────────────────────
#
# Not a stylistic split. `ccache_cache_key` runs `"$compiler" --version` ON THE
# HOST, and for a containerized lane that compiler does not exist there — the
# wheel is built by gcc-toolset-14 inside manylinux_2_28. There is nothing to
# probe, so the identity has to come from somewhere else entirely.
#
# ── WHY THE IMAGE DIGEST IS THE IDENTITY ─────────────────────────────────────
#
# The digest moves if and only if the in-container toolchain moves — same
# compiler binary, same glibc headers, same libstdc++, or a different digest.
# That is a STRONGER invariant than the host lanes get from `--version`, which
# is only a proxy.
#
# ⚠️ AND IT MUST BE THE PINNED REFERENCE, NOT A REGISTRY LOOKUP OF THE ALIAS.
# cibuildwheel does not resolve `manylinux_2_28` against the registry at run
# time; it substitutes a digest from its OWN pin file. Measured 2026-08-17: the
# reference in use was `@sha256:012f4a50…`, while cibuildwheel `main` pinned the
# same alias to `@sha256:f854c50a…`. So `docker manifest inspect <alias>` answers
# a DIFFERENT question than "what will actually build this wheel", and keying on
# it would roll the tag when the toolchain had not moved and fail to roll when it
# had. The repo pins the image itself (bindings/python/pyproject.toml) precisely
# so this function can read the identity off a tracked file.
#
# ⚠️ NO SEPARATE TOOLCHAIN LABEL — deliberately. An earlier draft appended a
# hand-written `gcc14`. The day the pinned image moves to gcc-toolset-15 the
# digest rolls, everything keeps working, and the tag QUIETLY LIES about the
# toolchain — destroying the diagnostic that is the tag's whole justification.
